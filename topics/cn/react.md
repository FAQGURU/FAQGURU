What is virtual DOM? 什么是虚拟 DOM？

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM. It’s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.
虚拟 DOM (VDOM)是 Real DOM 的内存中表示。 Ui 的表示保存在内存中，并与"真正的"DOM 同步。 这是在调用呈现函数和在屏幕上显示元素之间的一个步骤。 这整个过程叫做和解。

How does React work? 如何反应工作？

React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a "diffing" algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.

What are stateful components? 什么是有状态组件？

If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These Stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.
如果组件的行为依赖于组件的状态，那么它可以被称为有状态组件。 这些有状态组件总是类组件，并且具有在构造函数中初始化的状态。

What are stateless components? 什么是无状态组件？

If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for stateless functional components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use stateless functional components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.
如果该行为独立于其状态，那么它可以是无状态组件。 您可以使用函数或类来创建无状态组件。 但是，除非您需要在组件中使用生命周期挂钩，否则应该使用无状态的功能组件。 如果您决定在这里使用无状态功能组件，那么它们有很多好处; 它们易于编写、理解和测试，而且您可以完全避免使用这个关键字。

What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument? 使用超级构造函数和道具参数的目的是什么？

A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until super() method has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props in your child constructors.
在调用 super ()方法之前，子类构造函数不能使用此引用。 Es6子类也是如此。 将 props 参数传递给 super ()调用的主要原因是在子构造函数中访问 this.props。
Passing props:
传球道具:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log(this.props);  // Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }
    }
}
Not passing props:
不是传球道具:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super();
        console.log(this.props); // Prints undefined
        // But Props parameter is still available
        console.log(props); // Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }
    }

    render() {
        // No difference outside constructor
        console.log(this.props) // Prints { name: 'sudheer',age: 30 }
    }
}
The above code snippets reveals that this.props behavior is different only with in the constructor. It would be same outside the constructor.

What are Higher-Order components? 什么是高阶组件？

A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it’s a pattern that is derived from React’s compositional nature We call them as “pure’ components”  because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won’t modify or copy any behavior from their input components.
高阶组件(HOC)是接受组件并返回新组件的函数。 基本上，这是一个源自 React 组合特性的模式。我们称它们为"纯"组件，因为它们可以接受任何动态提供的子组件，但是它们不会从输入组件中修改或复制任何行为。
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
HOC can be used for many use cases as below,
可以用于下面的许多用例,

What are controlled components? 什么是受控组件？

A ReactJS component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called “Controlled component”. i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.
控制后续用户输入表单中的输入元素的 ReactJS 组件称为"受控组件"。 也就是说，每个状态变异都会有一个相关的处理函数。
For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,
例如，要用大写字母书写所有名称，我们使用 handleChange，如下所示:
handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
        value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()
    });

What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container component? 表现型组件和容器组件之间的区别是什么？

* Presentational components are concerned with how things look. They generally receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. These components rarely have their own state, but when they do it generally concerns UI state, as opposed to data state.
表象组件关注事物的外观。 他们通常只通过道具接收数据和回调。 这些组件很少有自己的状态，但是当它们这样做时，通常关注 UI 状态，而不是数据状态。
* Container components are more concerned with how things work. These components provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components. They call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to the presentational components. They are also often stateful as they serve as data sources.
容器组件更关心事物的工作方式。 这些组件向表示组件或其他容器组件提供数据和行为。 它们调用 Flux 操作，并将这些操作作为对表示组件的回调提供。 它们也常常是有状态的，因为它们充当数据源。

How to create refs? 如何创建裁判员？

Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property with in constructor.
Refs 使用 React.createRef ()方法创建，并通过 ref 属性附加到 React 元素。 为了在整个组件中使用 refs，只需使用 In 构造函数将 ref 分配给实例属性。
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
And:
还有:
class UserForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value is: ", this.input.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={(input) => this.input = input} /> // Access DOM input in handle submit
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}

What are the differences between a class component and functional component? 类组件和功能组件之间的区别是什么？

* Class components allows you to use additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Also, to enable your component to have direct access to your store and thus holds state.
类组件允许您使用其他特性，比如本地状态和生命周期挂钩。 另外，为了使您的组件能够直接访问您的存储，从而保存状态。
* When your component just receives props and renders them to the page, this is a stateless component, for which a pure function can be used. These are also called dumb components or presentational components.
当您的组件只是接收道具并将它们呈现到页面时，这是一个无状态组件，可以使用纯函数。 这些组件也称为哑组件或表象组件。

What is the difference between state and props? 国家和道具有什么区别？

The state is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events.
状态是一个数据结构，在组件挂载时以一个默认值开始。 它可能会随着时间的推移而变异，主要是由于用户事件的结果。
Props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration. They are received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them is concerned. A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible for putting together the props of its child Components. Props do not have to just be data - callback functions may be passed in as props.
道具(性能的缩写)是一个组件的配置。 就接收它们的组件而言，它们是从上面接收而且是不可变的。 一个组件不能改变它的道具，但是它负责组合它的子组件的道具。 道具不必只是数据回调函数，可以作为道具传递。

How is React different from AngularJS (1.x)? 和 AngularJS (1.x)有什么不同？

For example, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application — these abstractions are certainly useful in some cases, but they come at the cost of flexibility.
例如，AngularJS (1.x)通过在运行时扩展 HTML 标记并注入各种构造(如指令、控制器、服务)来构建应用程序。 因此，AngularJS 对于应用程序的更大体系结构非常固执ーー这些抽象在某些情况下当然是有用的，但它们是以灵活性为代价的。
By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application’s architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem “best” — though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer.
相比之下，React 专注于组件的创建，对应用程序的体系结构几乎没有(如果有的话)意见。 这使得开发人员在选择他们认为"最佳"的体系结构时拥有难以置信的灵活性ーー尽管这也将选择(或构建)这些部分的责任交给了开发人员。

How to create components in ReactJS? 如何在 ReactJS 中创建组件？

There are two possible ways to create ReactJS Components.
有两种可能的方法来创建 ReactJS 组件。
1. Functional components: This is the simplest way to create ReactJS components. It accepts props as an Object and returns ReactJS elements. We call it as “functional” because those are pure JavaScript functions. 函数组件: 这是创建 ReactJS 组件的最简单方法。 它接受 props 作为 Object 并返回 ReactJS 元素。 我们称之为"函数式"，因为它们是纯粹的 JavaScript 函数

What is the difference between Element and Component? 元素和组件的区别是什么？

An element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated. The object representation of React element would be as follows,
元素是一个普通对象，用 DOM 节点或其他组件描述您希望在屏幕上显示的内容。 元素可以包含其他元素在他们的道具。 创建一个 React 元素是很便宜的。 一个元素一旦被创造出来，它永远不会发生变异。 React 元素的对象表示如下,
const element = React.createElement(
  'div',
  {id: 'login-btn'},
  'Login'
)
The above createElement returns as object as below,
上面的 createElement 作为对象返回，如下所示,
{
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    children: 'Login',
    id: 'login-btn'
  }
}
And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render as below,
最后，它使用 ReactDOM.render 向 DOM 渲染，如下所示,
<div id='login-btn'>Login</div>
Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output. JSX transpiled as createElement at the end.
而组件可以通过几种不同的方式进行声明。 它可以是一个具有 render ()方法的类。 或者，在简单的情况下，它可以定义为一个函数。 无论哪种情况，它都接受 props 作为输入，并返回一个元素树作为输出。 Jsx 最后以 createElement 的身份出现。
function Button ({ onLogin }) {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    {id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin},
    'Login'
  )

What are refs used for in React? 在 React 中，裁判是用来干什么的？

Refs are an escape hatch which allow you to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. In order to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument.
Refs 是一个逃生出口，允许您直接访问 DOM 元素或组件的实例。 为了使用它们，您需要向组件添加一个 ref 属性，该属性的值是一个回调函数，该函数将接收基础 DOM 元素或组件挂载的实例作为它的第一个参数。
class UnControlledForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value: ", this.input.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={(input) => this.input = input} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
Above notice that our input field has a ref attribute whose value is a function. That function receives the actual DOM element of input which we then put on the instance in order to have access to it inside of the handleSubmit function.
注意，我们的输入字段有一个 ref 属性，它的值是一个函数。 该函数接收输入的实际 DOM 元素，然后将其放在实例上，以便在 handlessubmit 函数内部访问它。
It’s often misconstrued that you need to use a class component in order to use refs, but refs can also be used with functional components by leveraging closures in JavaScript.
为了使用 refs，您需要使用类组件，这常常被误解，但是通过利用 JavaScript 中的闭包，refs 也可以与函数组件一起使用。
function CustomForm ({handleSubmit}) {
  let inputElement
  return (

      <input
        type='text'
        ref={(input) => inputElement = input} />
      <button type='submit'>Submit</button>

When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose? 当渲染一个列表时，什么是一个键，它的目的是什么？

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.
键帮助反应标识哪些项目已经更改，被添加，或被删除。 应该为数组中的元素提供键，以使元素具有稳定的标识。 选择键的最佳方法是使用一个字符串，该字符串在同级列表项中唯一地标识该列表项。
render () {
  return (
    <ul>
      {this.state.todoItems.map(({task, uid}) => {
        return <li key={uid}>{task}</li>
      })}
    </ul>
  )
}
Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys. When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort. It is not recommend to use indexes for keys if the items can reorder, as that would be slow.
大多数情况下，您将使用数据中的 id 作为键。 当您没有呈现项的稳定 id 时，您可以使用项目索引作为最后的手段。 如果项目可以重新排序，则不建议对键使用索引，因为这样会很慢。

Where in a React component should you make an AJAX request? 在 React 组件的什么位置你应该发出 AJAX 请求？

componentDidMount is where an AJAX request should be made in a React component.
Componentdidmount 是在 React 组件中发出 AJAX 请求的地方。
This method will be executed when the component “mounts” (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only executed once during the component’s life. Importantly, you can’t guarantee the AJAX request will have resolved before the component mounts. If it doesn't, that would mean that you’d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which would not work. Making your AJAX request in componentDidMount will guarantee that there’s a component to update.
该方法将在组件"挂载"(第一次添加到 DOM 中)时执行。 此方法在组件的生命周期中只执行一次。 重要的是，您不能保证 AJAX 请求会在组件挂载之前得到解决。 如果不能，那就意味着您将尝试在一个未装载的组件上设置 state，这将无法工作。 在 componentDidMount 中发出 AJAX 请求将保证有一个要更新的组件。

Describe how events are handled in React. 描述在 React 中如何处理事件

In order to solve cross browser compatibility issues, your event handlers in React will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, which is React’s cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. These synthetic events have the same interface as native events you’re used to, except they work identically across all browsers.
为了解决跨浏览器兼容性问题，React 中的事件处理程序将传递 SyntheticEvent 实例，这是 React 围绕浏览器本机事件的跨浏览器包装器。 这些合成事件与您习惯使用的本机事件具有相同的接口，只是它们在所有浏览器中的工作方式相同。
What’s mildly interesting is that React doesn’t actually attach events to the child nodes themselves. React will listen to all events at the top level using a single event listener. This is good for performance and it also means that React doesn’t need to worry about keeping track of event listeners when updating the DOM.
稍微有趣的是 React 实际上并没有将事件附加到子节点本身。 React 将使用一个事件监听器在顶层监听所有事件。 这对性能有好处，也意味着 React 在更新 DOM 时不需要跟踪事件侦听器。

What happens when you call "setState"? 当您调用"setState"时会发生什么？

The first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state.
在调用 setState 时，React 要做的第一件事是将传递到 setState 中的对象合并到组件的当前状态中。 这将开启一个被称为和解的过程。 和解的最终目标是，尽可能以最有效的方式，基于这个新状态更新 UI。
To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree.
为此，React 将构建一个 React 元素的新树(您可以将其视为 UI 的对象表示形式)。 一旦有了这个树，为了弄清楚 UI 应该如何响应新状态，React 将使这个新树与之前的元素树有所不同。
By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary.
通过这样做，React 将知道确切发生的更改，并且通过确切知道发生了什么更改，将能够通过在绝对必要的情况下进行更新来最小化其在 UI 上的占用空间。

What is Key and benefit of using it in lists?

A key is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
For example, most often we use IDs from your data as keys
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
    <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
    </li>
);
When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
    <li key={index}>
        {todo.text}
    </li>
);
Note:
1. We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state
2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on list component instead li tag.
There will be a warning in the console if the key is not present on list items.

What's the difference between an Element and a Component in React?

Elements are the fundamental building blocks of React, and describe what you want to see on the screen. They are just simple JS objects with props, key, ref, and type properties, whereas Components have a render method and optionally accept inputs.

Name the different lifecycle methods.

* componentWillMount- this is most commonly used for App configuration in your root component.
* componentDidMount - here you want to do all the setup you couldn’t do without a DOM, and start getting all the data you need. Also if you want to set up eventListeners etc. this lifecycle hook is a good place to do that.
* componentWillReceiveProps - this lifecyclye acts on particular prop changes to trigger state transitions.
* shouldComponentUpdate - if you’re worried about wasted renders shouldComponentUpdate is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop. shouldComponentUpdate should always return a boolean and based on what this is will determine if the component is rerendered or not.
* componentWillUpdate - rarely used. It can be used instead of componentWillReceiveProps on a component that also has shouldComponentUpdate (but no access to previous props).
* componentDidUpdate - also commonly used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
* componentWillUnmount - here you can cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

Given the code defined above, can you identify two problems?

Take a look at the code below:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    // set the default internal state
    this.state = {
      clicks: 0
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.refs.myComponentDiv.addEventListener('click', this.clickHandler);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.refs.myComponentDiv.removeEventListener('click', this.clickHandler);
  }

  clickHandler() {
    this.setState({
      clicks: this.clicks + 1
    });
  }

  render() {
    let children = this.props.children;

    return (
      <div className="my-component" ref="myComponentDiv">
      <h2>My Component ({this.state.clicks} clicks})</h2>
      <h3>{this.props.headerText}</h3>
    {children}
    </div>
    );
  }
}
Given the code defined above, can you identify two problems?
Answer:
1. The constructor does not pass its props to the super class. It should include the following line:
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  // ...
}
2. The event listener (when assigned via addEventListener()) is not properly scoped because ES2015 doesn’t provide autobinding. Therefore the developer can re-assign clickHandler in the constructor to include the correct binding to this:
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this);
  // ...
}

What are stateless components?

Stateless components (a flavor of “reusable” components) are nothing more than pure functions that render DOM based solely on the properties provided to them.
const StatelessCmp = props => {
  return (
    <div className="my-stateless-component">
    {props.name}: {props.birthday}
    </div>
  );
};

// ---
ReactDOM.render(
  <StatelessCmp name="Art" birthday="10/01/1980" />,
  document.getElementById('main')
);
This component has no need for any internal state — let alone a constructor or lifecycle handlers. The output of the component is purely a function of the properties provided to it.

What are Pure Components?

PureComponent is exactly the same as Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate method for you. When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. Component, on the other hand, won’t compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.

Why should not we update the state directly?

If you try to update state directly then it won’t re-render the component.
    //Wrong
    This.state.message =”Hello world”;
Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component’s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering
    //Correct
    This.setState({message: ‘Hello World’});
Note: The only place you can assign the state is constructor.

What are controlled components?

In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. When a user submits a form the values from the aforementioned elements are sent with the form. With React it works differently. The component containing the form will keep track of the value of the input in it's state and will re-render the component each time the callback function e.g. onChange is fired as the state will be updated. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a controlled component.

1. In HTML, the event name should be in lowercase.
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
Whereas in ReactJS it follows camelCase convention,
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
2. In HTML, you can return false to prevent default behavior,
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false"/>
3. Whereas in ReactJS you must call preventDefault explicitly,
function handleClick(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      console.log('The link was clicked.');

How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?

There are 3 possible ways to achieve,
1. Binding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for ReactJS event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor as follows,
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}

handleClick() {
    // Perform some logic
}
2. Public class fields syntax: If you don’t like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks
handleClick = () => {
     console.log('this is:', this);
}
<button onClick={this.handleClick}>
     Click me
</button>
3. Arrow functions in callbacks: You can use arrow functions directly in the callbacks as below
<button onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}>
      Click me
</button>

What can you tell me about JSX?

When Facebook first released React to the world, they also introduced a new dialect of JavaScript called JSX that embeds raw HTML templates inside JavaScript code. JSX code by itself cannot be read by the browser; it must be transpiled into traditional JavaScript using tools like Babel and webpack. While many developers understandably have initial knee-jerk reactions against it, JSX (in tandem with ES2015) has become the defacto method of defining React components.
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let props = this.props;  
    return (
      <div className="my-component">
      <a href={props.url}>{props.name}</a>

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.input = React.createRef();
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value);

There are four different phases of React component’s lifecycle:
1. Initialization: In this phase react component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.
2. Mounting: The react component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers componentWillMount and componentDidMount lifecycle methods.
3. Updating: In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate lifecycle methods.

* React.Children.forEach,
* React.Children.count,
* React.Children.only,
* React.Children.toArray.
A simple usage of children prop looks as below,
var MyDiv = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <div>{this.props.children}</div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyDiv>

What does "shouldComponentUpdate" do and why is it important?

What shouldComponentUpdate does is it’s a lifecycle method that allows us to opt out of setState reconciliation process for certain components (and their child components). If we know that a certain section of our UI isn’t going to change, there’s no reason to have React go through the trouble of trying to figure out if it should. By returning false from shouldComponentUpdate, React will assume that the current component, and all its child components, will stay the same as they currently are.

What advantages are using arrow functions?

* Scope safety: Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value (a new object in the case of a constructor, undefined in strict mode function calls, the base object if the function is called as an "object method", etc.). An arrow function does not create its own this, the this value of the enclosing execution context is used.
* Compactness: Arrow functions are easier to read and write.
* Clarity: When almost everything is an arrow function, any regular function immediately sticks out for defining the scope. A developer can always look up the next-higher function statement to see what the thisObject is.

What are error boundaries in ReactJS (16)?

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info)
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Display fallback UI
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;

What is a higher order component?

A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOC's allow you to reuse code, logic and bootstrap abstraction.

Typically you’d use Webpack’s DefinePlugin method to set NODE_ENV to production. This will strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings.

Describe Flux vs MVC?

Traditional MVC patterns have worked well for separating the concerns of data (Model), UI (View) and logic (Controller) — but MVC architectures frequently encounter two main problems:
* Poorly defined data flow: The cascading updates which occur across views often lead to a tangled web of events which is difficult to debug.
* Lack of data integrity: Model data can be mutated from anywhere, yielding unpredictable results across the UI.
With the Flux pattern complex UIs no longer suffer from cascading updates; any given React component will be able to reconstruct its state based on the data provided by the store. The Flux pattern also enforces data integrity by restricting direct access to the shared data.

Are you familiar with Flux?

Flux is an architectural pattern that enforces unidirectional data flow — its core purpose is to control derived data so that multiple components can interact with that data without risking pollution.
The Flux pattern is generic; it’s not specific to React applications, nor is it required to build a React app. However, Flux is commonly used by React developers because React components are declarative — the rendered UI (View) is simply a function of state (Store data).
In the Flux pattern, the Store is the central authority for all data; any mutations to the data must occur within the store. Changes to the Store data are subsequently broadcast to subscribing Views via events. Views then update themselves based on the new state of received data.
To request changes to any Store data, Actions may be fired. These Actions are controlled by a central Dispatcher; Actions may not occur simultaneously, ensuring that a Store only mutates data once per Action.
The strict unidirectional flow of this Flux pattern enforces data stability, reducing data-related runtime errors throughout an application.

A callback function which will be invoked when setState has finished and the component is re-rendered.

Nothing is wrong with it.

What is "Children"?

In JSX expressions that contain both an opening tag and a closing tag, the content between those tags is passed to components automatically as a special prop: props.children.
There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop. These include:
* React.Children.map
* React.Children.forEach
* React.Children.count
* React.Children.only
* React.Children.toArray

What's a pure functional component in React?

A component that has no internal state of its own, nor any side effects, and thus is often written as a function as opposed to an ES6 class.

What is the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled component?

* A controlled component is a component where React is in control and is the single source of truth for the form data.
* An uncontrolled component is where your form data is handled by the DOM, instead of inside your React component.
Though uncontrolled components are typically easier to implement since you just grab the value from the DOM using refs, it’s typically recommended that you favor controlled components over uncontrolled components. The main reasons for this are that controlled components support instant field validation, allow you to conditionally disable/enable buttons, enforce input formats, and are more “the React way”.

What is the difference between Flow and PropTypes?

* Flow is a static analysis tool (static checker) which uses a superset of the language, allowing you to add type annotations to all of your code and catch an entire class of bugs at compile time.
* PropTypes is a basic type checker (runtime checker) which has been patched onto React. It can't check anything other than the types of the props being passed to a given component. If you want more flexible typechecking for your entire project then Flow/TypeScript are appropriate choices.

What is the purpose of super(props)?

A child class constructor cannot make use of this until super() has been called. Also, ES2015 class constructors have to call super() if they are subclasses. The reason for passing props to super() is to enable you to access this.props in the constructor.

Why would you need to bind event handlers to "this"?

You need to do this in order for this to refer to the object instance of the React component class in your callback code, otherwise this will be undefined. An alternative is to use arrow functions in your event handlers and 'this' will be initialized as expected.

If you created a React element like Twitter below, what would the component definition of Twitter look like?

Question:
If you created a React element like Twitter below, what would the component definition of Twitter look like?
<Twitter username='tylermcginnis33'>
  {(user) => user === null
    ? <Loading />
    : <Badge info={user} />}
</Twitter>
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'
import fetchUser from 'twitter'
// fetchUser take in a username returns a promise
// which will resolve with that username's data.

class Twitter extends Component {
  // finish this
}
Answer:
Instead of another component as you’ve probably seen before, the Twitter component’s child is a function. What this means is that in the implementation of the Twitter component, we’ll need to treat props.children as a function.
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'
import fetchUser from 'twitter'

class Twitter extends Component {
  state = {
    user: null,
  }
  static propTypes = {
    username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  }
  componentDidMount () {
    fetchUser(this.props.username)
      .then((user) => this.setState({user}))
  }
  render () {
    return this.props.children(this.state.user)
  }
}
What’s great about this pattern is that we’ve decoupled our parent component from our child component. The parent component manages the state and the consumer of the parent component can decide in which way they’d like to apply the arguments they receive from the parent to their UI.

Which is preferred option with in callback refs and findDOMNode()?

It is preferred to use callback refs over findDOMNode() API because findDOMNode() prevents certain improvements in React in the future.
The legacy approach of using findDOMNode():
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
  }

  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}
The recommended approach is
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.node.scrollIntoView();
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={node => this.node = node} />
  }
}

Why are String Refs legacy?

If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the ref attribute is a string, like textInput, and the DOM node is accessed as this.refs.textInput. We advise against it because string refs have below issues, are considered legacy, and are likely to be removed in one of the future releases.
1. It requires that React keeps track of currently rendering component (since it can't guess this). This makes React a bit slower.
2. It is not composable, i.e. if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.

How to apply validation on Props in ReactJS?

When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check  for all props that we set on components to make sure they must right correct and right data type. For incorrect type, it will generate warning messages in the console for development mode whereas it is disabled in production mode due performance impact. The mandatory prop is defined with isRequired.
The set of predefined prop types are below
1. React.PropTypes.string
2. React.PropTypes.number
3. React.PropTypes.func
4. React.PropTypes.node
5. React.PropTypes.bool
For example, we define propTypes for user component as below,
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class User extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>
      <h2>Age, {this.props.age}
    );
  }
}

User.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number.isRequired

};

What is React Fiber?

Fiber is the new reconciliation engine or reimplementation core algorithm in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, gestures, ability to pause, abort, or reuse work and  assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

What are the recommended ways for static type checking?

Normally we use PropTypes library( React.PropTypes moved to a different package since React15.5) for TypeChecking in the ReactJS applications. For large code bases, it is recommended to use static type checkers such as Flow or TypeScript to find out problems before run the code and provides auto-completion feature.

What is the difference between ReactJS and Angular?

ReactJS	Angular
React is a Library and has only the View layer	Angular is a Framework and has complete MVC functionality
React handle rendering on the server side	Angular JS render on the client side but Angular 2 and above render on the server side
In React, HTML is written in JS which can be confusing	Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand.
React native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable	Ionic, Angular’s mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower
In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy	In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult

Explain the Virtual DOM concept in React.

React builds up its own "virtual DOM" which is a lightweight representation of the DOM optimized for React's diffing algorithms and reconciliation process. Virtual DOM changes eventually propagate to the actual DOM at the end of the reconciliation process.

What is reselect and how it works?

Reselect is a selector library (for Redux) which uses memoization concept. It was originally written to compute derived data from redux-like applications state, but it can't be tied to any architecture or library.
Reselect keeps a copy of the last inputs/outputs of the last call, and recomputes the result only if one of the inputs changes. If the the same inputs are provided twice in a row, Reselect return the cached saved output. It's memoization and cache are fully customizable.

How to use Polymer in ReactJS?

Yes, it is possible. You need to follow below steps
1. Create a polymer element.
<link rel="import" href="../../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
Polymer({
    is: 'calender-element',
    ready: function(){
        this.textContent = "I am a calender";
    }
});
2. Make the polymer component a html tag by importing it in a html page. E.g. import it in the index.html of your react application
<link rel="import" href="./src/polymer-components/calender-element.html">
3. Use that element in the jsx file.
'use strict';
import React from 'react';
class MyComponent extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return (
            <calender-element></calender-element>
        );
    }
}
export default MyComponent;

Explain some difference between Flux and AngularJS (1.x) approach

UI components in AngularJS typically rely on some internal $scope to store their data. This data can be directly mutated from within the UI component or anything given access to $scope — a risky situation for any part of the component or greater application which relies on that data.
By contrast, the Flux pattern encourages the use of immutable data. Because the store is the central authority on all data, any mutations to that data must occur within the store. The risk of data pollution is greatly reduced.

What is Redux Thunk used for?

Redux thunk is middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can then be used to delay the dispatch of an action if a certain condition is met. This allows you to handle the asyncronous dispatching of actions.
