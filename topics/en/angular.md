### What is Routing Guard in Angular?

Angular’s route guards are interfaces which can tell the router whether or not it should allow navigation to a requested route. They make this decision by looking for a true or false return value from a class which implements the given guard interface.

### What is a module, and what does it contain?

An Angular module is set of Angular basic building blocks like component, directives, services etc. An app can have more than one module.

A module can be created using `@NgModule` decorator.

```js
@NgModule({
  imports:      [ BrowserModule ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### What are pipes? Give me an example.

A **pipe** takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output. You can chain pipes together in potentially useful combinations. You can write your own custom pipes. Angular comes with a stock of pipes such as `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, and `PercentPipe`.

Consider:
```html
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>
```
In this page, you'll use pipes to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date.

### What's the difference between an Angular component and module?

*Components* control views (html). They also communicate with other components and services to bring functionality to your app.

*Modules* consist of one or more components. They do not control any html. Your modules declare which components can be used by components belonging to other modules, which classes will be injected by the dependency injector and which component gets bootstrapped. Modules allow you to manage your components to bring modularity to your app.

### What are the differences between AngularJS (angular 1.x) and Angular (Angular 2.x and beyond)?

Angular and AngularJS is basically a different framework with the same name.

Angular is more ready for the current state of web standards and the future state of the web (ES6\7, immutiablity, components, shadow DOM, service workers, mobile compatibilty, modules, typescript and so on and so on... )

Angular killed many main features in AngularJS like - controllers, $scope, directives (replaced with `@component` annotations), the module definition, and much more, even simple things like ng-repeat has not left the same as it was.

Also: 
1. They added an angular `cli`.
2. Your angular code is written in ES6 Typescript and it compiles at runtime to Javascript in the browser.
3. You bind to your HTML similarly like how you would if in an Angular 1 directive. So variable like $scope and $rootScope have been deprecated.

### What is a service, and when will you use it?

*Angular services* are singleton objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They contain methods that maintain data throughout the life of an application, i.e. data does not get refreshed and is available all the time. The main objective of a service is to organize and share business logic, models, or data and functions with different components of an Angular application.

The *separation of concerns* is the main reason why Angular services came into existence. An Angular service is a stateless object and provides some very useful functions.

### What is the minimum definition of a component?

The absolute minimal configuration for a `@Component` in Angular is a template. Both template properties are set to optional because you have to define either `template` or `templateUrl`.

When you don't define them, you will get an exception like this:
```sh
No template specified for component 'ComponentName'
```
A selector property is not required, as you can also use your components in a route.

### What is a component? Why would you use it?

*Components* are the most basic building block of an UI in an Angular application. An Angular application is a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.

A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application. To specify that a component is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the `declarations` field of that NgModule.

```js
@Component({selector: 'greet', template: 'Hello {{name}}!'})
class Greet {
  name: string = 'World';
}
```

### How can I select an element in a component template?

You can get a handle to the DOM element via ElementRef by injecting it into your component's constructor:

### What is the difference between *ngIf vs [hidden]?

`*ngIf` effectively removes its content from the DOM while `[hidden]` modifies the `display` property and only instructs the browser to not show the content but the DOM still contains it.

### What is the difference between "@Component" and "@Directive" in Angular? 

* **Directives** add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance.
* **A component**, rather than adding/modifying behaviour, actually creates its own view (hierarchy of DOM elements) with attached behaviour.

Write a component when you want to create a reusable set of DOM elements of UI with custom behaviour. Write a directive when you want to write reusable behaviour to supplement existing DOM elements.

### How would you protect a component being activated through the router?

The Angular router ships with a feature called guards. These provide us with ways to control the flow of our application. We can stop a user from visitng certain routes, stop a user from leaving routes, and more. The overall process for protecting Angular routes:

* Create a guard service: `ng g guard auth`
* Create `canActivate()` or `canActivateChild()` methods
* Use the guard when defining routes

```js
// import the newly created AuthGuard
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'account',
    canActivate: [AuthGuard]
  }
];
```

Some other available guards:

* `CanActivate`: Check if a user has access
* `CanActivateChild`: Check if a user has access to any of the child routes
* `CanDeactivate`: Can a user leave a page? For example, they haven't finished editing a post
* `Resolve`: Grab data before the route is instantiated
* `CanLoad`: Check to see if we can load the routes assets

### How would you run unit test?

The Angular CLI downloads and install everything you need to test an Angular application with the Jasmine test framework.

The project you create with the CLI is immediately ready to test. Just run this one CLI command:

```sh
ng test
```

### When would you use eager module loading?

**Eager loading**: To load a feature module eagerly we need to import it into application module using `imports` metadata of `@NgModule` decorator. Eager loading is useful in small size applications. In eager loading, all the feature modules will be loaded before the application starts. Hence the subsequent request to the application will be faster.

###  Explain the difference between `Promise` and `Observable` in Angular?

**Promises**:
- return a single value
- not cancellable
- more readable code with try/catch and async/await

**Observables**:
- work with multiple values over time
- cancellable
- support map, filter, reduce and similar operators
- use Reactive Extensions (RxJS)
- an array whose items arrive asynchronously over time

### How to bundle an Angular app for production?

**OneTime Setup**

*   `npm install -g @angular/cli`
*   `ng new projectFolder` creates a new application

**Bundling Step**

*   `ng build --prod` (run in command line when directory is `projectFolder`)
*   flag `prod` _bundle for production

_bundles are generated by default to_ **_projectFolder/dist/_**

**Deployment**

You can get a preview of your application using the `ng serve --prod` command that starts a local HTTP server such that the application with production files is accessible using [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

For a production usage, you have to deploy all the files from the `dist` folder in the HTTP server of your choice.

```

### Can you explain the difference between `Promise` and `Observable` in Angular? In what scenario can we use each case?

**Promise**

A `Promise` handles a **single event** when an async operation completes or fails. There are `Promise` libraries out there that support cancellation, but ES6 `Promise` doesn't so far.

**Observable**

An `Observable` is like a `**Stream**` (in many languages) and allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event.

Often `Observable` is preferred over `Promise` because it provides the features of `Promise` and more. With `Observable` it doesn't matter if you want to handle 0, 1, or multiple events. You can utilize the same API in each case.

`Observable` also has the advantage over `Promise` to be **cancelable**. If the result of an HTTP request to a server or some other expensive async operation isn't needed anymore, the `Subscription` of an `Observable` allows to cancel the subscription, while a `Promise` will eventually call the success or failed callback even when you don't need the notification or the result it provides anymore.

Observable provides **operators** like `map`, `forEach`, `reduce`, ... similar to an array
There are also powerful operators like `retry()`, or `replay()`, ... that are often quite handy.

### What is the use of codelyzer?

All enterprise applications follows a set of coding conventions and guidelines to maintain code in better way. **Codelyzer** is an open source tool to run and check whether the pre-defined coding guidelines has been followed or not. Codelyzer does only static code analysis for angular and typescript project.

Codelyzer runs on top of tslint and its coding conventions are usually defined in tslint.json file. Codelyzer can be run via angular cli or npm directly. Editors like Visual Studio Code and Atom also supports codelyzer just by doing a basic settings.

### Why should `ngOnInit` be used, if we already have a `constructor`?

* The `Constructor` is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated and ensures proper initialization of fields in the class and its subclasses. 

* `ngOnInit` is a life cycle hook called by Angular2 to indicate that Angular is done creating the component.

Mostly we use `ngOnInit` for all the initialization/declaration and avoid stuff to work in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to initialize class members but shouldn't do actual "work". So you should use `constructor()` to setup Dependency Injection and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to "start" - it's where/when components' bindings are resolved.

### What is difference between "declarations", "providers" and "import" in NgModule?

*   `imports` makes the exported declarations of other modules available in the current module
*   `declarations` are to make directives (including components and pipes) from the current module available to other directives in the current module. Selectors of directives, components or pipes are only matched against the HTML if they are declared or imported.
*   `providers` are to make services and values known to DI. They are added to the root scope and they are injected to other services or directives that have them as dependency.

A special case for `providers` are lazy loaded modules that get their own child injector. `providers` of a lazy loaded module are only provided to this lazy loaded module by default (not the whole application as it is with other modules).

### What is Redux and how does it relate to an Angular app?

### What is AOT?

The Angular Ahead-of-Time compiler pre-compiles application components and their templates during the build process.
Apps compiled with AOT launch faster for several reasons. 
* Application components execute immediately, without client-side compilation. 
* Templates are embedded as code within their components so there is no client-side request for template files. 
* You don't download the Angular compiler, which is pretty big on its own. 
* The compiler discards unused Angular directives that a tree-shaking tool can then exclude.

### How would you control size of an element on resize of the window in a component?

`@HostListener` lets you listen for events on the host element or component.

This is a function decorator that accepts an event name as an argument. When that event gets fired on the host element it calls the associated function.

Consider:
```js
@HostListener('window:resize', ['$event'])
onResize(event: any) {
    this.calculateBodyHeight();
}
```

### What is the point of calling "renderer.invokeElementMethod(rendererEl, methodName)"?

### What is Reactive Programming and how to use one with Angular?

*Reactive programming* is programming with asynchronous data streams. An Angular application is a reactive system. 

There are many ways to implement event streams or reified reactive programming. Angular embraced RxJS, and the EventEmitter class is just an implementation of RxJS/Observable.

In RxJS, you represent asynchronous data streams using observable sequences or also just called *observables*.

### Why would you use a spy in a test?

Jasmine has a concept called `spies`. You can check if it was called, what parameters it had, if it returned something or even how many times it was called.

Consider:

it('can accept a post to update it', function() {
  var postToAccept = {
    title: 'Title',
    body: 'Post'
  };
  spyOn(rest, 'update').and.callThrough();
  post.accept(postToAccept);
  expect(rest.update).toHaveBeenCalledWith(postToAccept);

### What's new in Angular 6 and why shall we upgrade to it?

* **Angular Elements** - Angular Elements is a project that lets you wrap your Angular components as Web Components and embed them in a non-Angular application. 
* **New Rendering Engine: Ivy** -  increases in speed and decreases in application size.
* **Tree-shakeable providers** - a new, recommended, way to register a provider, directly inside the @Injectable() decorator, using the new `providedIn` attribute
* **RxJS 6** - Angular 6 now uses RxJS 6 internally, and requires you to update your application also. RxJS released a library called rxjs-compat, that allows you to bump RxJS to version 6.0 even if you, or one of the libraries you’re using, is still using one of the “old” syntaxes.
* **ElementRef`<T>`** - in Angular 5.0 or older, is that the said ElementRef had its nativeElement property typed as any. In Angular 6.0, you can now type ElementRef more strictly. 
* **Animations** - The polyfill web-animations-js is not necessary anymore for animations in Angular 6.0, except if you are using the AnimationBuilder.

### What is the difference between `@Component` and `@Directive` in Angular?

**A @Component requires a view whereas a @Directive does not.**

**Directives**

I liken a @Directive to an Angular 1.0 directive with the option `restrict: 'A'`
(Directives aren't limited to attribute usage.) Directives add behaviour to an
existing DOM element or an existing component instance. One example use case for
a directive would be to log a click on an element.

**Components**

A component, rather than adding/modifying behaviour, actually creates its own
view (hierarchy of DOM elements) with attached behaviour. An example use case
for this might be a contact card component:

Write a component when you want to create a reusable set of DOM elements of UI
with custom behaviour. Write a directive when you want to write reusable
behaviour to supplement existing DOM elements.

### What is Protractor?

**Protractor** is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor is a Node.js program built on top of WebDriverJS. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.

### What is TestBed?

The **Angular Test Bed (ATB)** is a higher level *Angular Only* testing framework that allows us to easily test behaviours that depend on the Angular Framework.

We still write our tests in Jasmine and run using Karma but we now have a slightly easier way to create components, handle injection, test asynchronous behaviour and interact with our application.

The TestBed creates a dynamically-constructed Angular test module that emulates an Angular `@NgModule`.

### How to set headers for every request in Angular?

You could provide a service that wraps the original `Http` object from Angular.
```js
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Http, Headers } from '@angular/http';

@Injectable() export class HttpClient {
    constructor(private http: Http) {}

    createAuthorizationHeader(headers: Headers) {
        headers.append('Authorization', 'Basic ' + btoa('username:password'));
    }

    get(url) {
        let headers = new Headers();
        this.createAuthorizationHeader(headers);
        return this.http.get(url, {
            headers: headers
        });
    }

    post(url, data) {
        let headers = new Headers();
        this.createAuthorizationHeader(headers);
        return this.http.post(url, data, {
            headers: headers
        });
    }
}
```
And instead of injecting the `Http` object you could inject this one (`HttpClient`).
```js
import { HttpClient } from './http-client';
```

### Why would you use renderer methods instead of using native element methods?

Angular is a platform, and the browser is just one option for where we can render our app. When we access the native element directly we are giving up on Angular’s DOM abstraction and miss out on the opportunity to be able to execute also in none-DOM environments such as: 
* native mobile, 
* native desktop, 
* web worker
* server side rendering.

The `Renderer2` class is an abstraction provided by Angular in the form of a service that allows to manipulate elements of your app without having to touch the DOM directly. This is the recommended approach because it then makes it easier to develop apps that can be rendered in environments that don’t have DOM access, like on the server, in a web worker or on native mobile.

### When does a lazy loaded module is loaded?

**Lazy loading** speeds up the application load time by splitting it into multiple bundles, and loading them on demand, as the user navigates throughout the app. As a result, the initial bundle is much smaller, which improves the bootstrap time.

**Lazy loading** is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components *asynchronously when a specific route is activated*. This can add some initial performance during the initial load, especially if you have many components with complex routing.

### What is the need for SystemJS in Angular?

When `tsc` compiles typescript into JavaScript, you end up with a bunch of js files on your local system. They somehow need to be loaded into a browser. Since browsers don't support native ES6 module loading yet, you have two options, either put them all into your index.html file in the correct order of dependencies, or you can use a loader to do that all for you. You specify the root for all modules, and then all files are loaded and executed by that loader in the correct order of dependencies. There are many loaders: `requirejs`, `webpack`, `systemjs` and others.

### Why would you use lazy loading modules in Angular app?

To load a feature module lazily we need to load it using `loadChildren` property in route configuration and that feature module must not be imported in application module. Lazy loading is useful when the application size is growing. In lazy loading, feature module will be loaded on demand and hence application start will be faster. 

```js
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'customers',
    loadChildren: 'app/customers/customers.module#CustomersModule'
  },
  {
    path: 'orders',
    loadChildren: 'app/orders/orders.module#OrdersModule'
  },
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: '',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  }
];

### What are the lifecycle hooks for components and directives?

A component in Angular has a life-cycle, a number of different phases it goes through from birth to death. We can hook into those different phases to get some pretty fine grained control of our application.

* **constructor**
This is invoked when Angular creates a component or directive by calling new on the class.
* **ngOnChanges**
Invoked every time there is a change in one of th input properties of the component.
* **ngOnInit**
Invoked when given component has been initialized.
This hook is only called once after the first ngOnChanges
* ** ngDoCheck**
Invoked when the change detector of the given component is invoked. It allows us to implement our own change detection algorithm for the given component.
* **ngOnDestroy**
This method will be invoked just before Angular destroys the component.
Use this hook to unsubscribe observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.

These hooks are only called for components and not directives.
* **ngAfterContentInit**
Invoked after Angular performs any content projection into the components view (see the previous lecture on Content Projection for more info).
* **ngAfterContentChecked**
Invoked each time the content of the given component has been checked by the change detection mechanism of Angular.
* **ngAfterViewInit**
Invoked when the component’s view has been fully initialized.
* **ngAfterViewChecked**
Invoked each time the view of the given component has been checked by the change detection mechanism of Angular.

    @ViewChild('template', { read: TemplateRef }) _template: TemplateRef<any>;
    constructor() { }

    ngAfterViewChecked() {
        this.vc.createEmbeddedView(this._template, {fromContext: 'John'});

### Name and explain some Angular Module Loading examples

A module can be loaded eagerly, lazily and preloaded:

* **Eager loading** is loading modules before application starts. Lazy loading is loading modules on demand. 
* **Preloading** is loading modules in background just after application starts. 
* In **lazy loading** and preloading, modules are loaded asynchronously. 

The application module i.e. `AppModule` is loaded eagerly before application starts. But the feature modules can be loaded either eagerly or lazily or preloaded.

### What does a just-in-time (JIT) compiler do (in general)?

A JIT compiler runs **after** the program has started and compiles the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions) on the fly (or just-in-time, as it's called) into a form that's usually faster, typically the host CPU's native instruction set. A JIT has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a standard compiler doesn't and can make better optimizations like inlining functions that are used frequently.

This is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles **all** the code to machine language **before** the program is first run.

### How do you create application to use scss? What changed for Angular 6?

This is how the style config in the CLI v1.x looks like in .angular-cli.json file.

```js
"defaults": {
  "styleExt": "scss",
  "component": {}
}
```

But if you take a look into a config schema of angular.json file in version 6, you will no longer find this config anymore. To use SCSS, simply import you scss files (the default value is ‘src/styles.scss’) in your project level in an angular.json file like this.

```js
{
  ...
  projects: {
    [your_project_name]: {
      ...
      architect: {
        build: {
          ...
          options: {
            styles:{
              "src/styles.scss"
            }
          }
        }
      }

### Are there any pros/cons (especially performance-wise) in using local storage to replace cookie functionality?

Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. 
* Cookies are primarily for reading *server-side*, 
* Local Storage can only be read by the client-side. 

So the question is, in your app, who needs this data — the client or the server? If it's your client (your JavaScript), then by all means switch to local storage. 
You're wasting bandwidth by sending all the data in each HTTP header.

If it's your server, local storage isn't so useful because you'd have to forward the data along somehow (with Ajax or hidden form fields or something). This might be okay if the server only needs a small subset of the total data for each request.

### What is Reactive programming and how does it relate to Angular?

Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams. RxJs stands for Reactive Extensions for Javascript, and it's an implementation of Observables for Javascript. An Observable is like a Stream (in many languages) and allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event. Angular currently uses RxJs Observables in two different ways:

* as an internal implementation mechanism, to implement some of its core logic like `EventEmitter`
* as part of its public API, namely in `Forms` and the `HTTP module`

You do not need to know Reactive Programming or RxJS in order to build even the most complex applications with Angular. It can however make some types of applications easier to architect.

### Name some security best practices in Angular

1. To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default (sanitation)
2. Angular templates are the same as executable code: HTML, attributes, and binding expressions (but not the values bound) in templates are trusted to be safe. To prevent these vulnerabilities, use the offline template compiler, also known as template injection.
3. Avoid interacting with the DOM directly and instead use Angular templates where possible.
4. Injecting template code into an Angular application is the same as injecting executable code into the application. So, validate all data on server-side code and escape appropriately to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server. 
5. Angular HttpClient provides built-in support to prevent XSRF attacks on the client side.
6. Servers can prevent the XSSI attack by prefixing all JSON responses to make them non-executable, by convention, using the well-known string `")]}',\n"`. Angular’s `HttpClient` library recognizes this convention and automatically strips the string `")]}',\n"` from all responses before further parsing.

### Could I use jQuery with Angular?

First install jQuery using npm as follows

```sh
npm install jquery — save
```
Second go to the `./angular-cli.json` file at the root of your Angular CLI project folder, and find the `scripts: [] property`, and include the path to jQuery as follows

```sh
“scripts”: [ “../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js” ]
```

Now to use jQuery anywhere in your application, all you have to do is to import it as follows in `app.component.ts` file.

```js
import * as $ from ‘jquery’;
```
Consider:

```js
import { Component, OnInit  } from '@angular/core';
import * as $ from 'jquery';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'Look jQuery Animation working in action!';

  public ngOnInit()
  {
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("button").click(function(){
            var div = $("div");  
            div.animate({left: '100px'}, "slow");
            div.animate({fontSize: '5em'}, "slow");
        });
    });
  }
}

### Do you know how you can run angularJS and angular side by side?

In order to run both frameworks side-by-side and make components interoperable, the Angular projects comes with a module **ngUpgrade**. The module basically acts as an adapter facade, so we don’t really feel that there are two frameworks running side-by-side.

For this to work, four things need to interoperate:

* Dependency Injection - Exposing Angular services into Angular 1.x components and vice-versa.
* Component Nesting - Angular 1 directives can be used in Angular 2.x components and Angular 2.x components can used Angular 1 directives
* Content Projection / Transclusion - Angular 1 components transclude Angular 2.x components and Angular 2.x component project Angular 1 directives
* Change Detection - Angular 1 scope digest and change detectors in Angular >= 2.x are interleaved

Here’s what a typical upgrade process would look like:

* Include Angular and upgrade module
* Pick component to upgrade and change its controller and template Angular 2.x syntax (this is now an Angular 2.x component)
* Downgrade Angular 2.x component to make it run in Angular 1.x app
* Pick a service to upgrade, this usually requires little amount of change (especially if we’re on ES2015)
* Repeat step 2 and 3 (and 4)
* Replace Angular 1 bootstrap with Angular 2.x bootstrap

### What is the difference between BehaviorSubject vs Observable?

BehaviorSubject is a type of subject, a subject is a special type of observable so you can subscribe to messages like any other observable. The unique features of BehaviorSubject are:

*   It needs an initial value as it must always return a value on subscription even if it hasn’t received a `next()`
*   Upon subscription it returns the last value of the subject. A regular observable only triggers when it receives an `onnext`
*   at any point you can retrieve the last value of the subject in a non-observable code using the `getValue()` method.

Unique features of a subject compared to an observable are:

*   It is an observer in addition to being an observable so you can also send values to a subject in addition to subscribing to it.

In addition you can get an observable from behavior subject using the `asobservable()` method on BehaviorSubject.

In Angular services, I would use BehaviorSubject for a data service as a angular service often initializes before component and behavior subject ensures that the component consuming the service receives the last updated data even if there are no new updates since the component’s subscription to this data.

 - Compiled by the machine itself, via the command line (Faster).
 - All code compiled together, inlining HTML/CSS in the scripts.
 - No need to deploy the compiler (Half of Angular size).
 - More secure, original source not disclosed.

### How would you extract webpack config from angular cli project?

 We usually use Angular CLI to scaffold our Angular app, but in this case, webpack file is hidden. `ng eject` was used if you need to do something a lot more advance or custom with webpack than what the cli provides for commands like `ng build` and `ng serve`. So it generates a `webpack.config.js` based on the configurations that the cli uses, so that you can then customize it further. However, that also means that you'll be able to use certain commands like `ng build` and `ng serve`.

The `eject` command has been temporarily disabled in Angular 6, as it is not yet compatible with the new angular.json format. The new configuration format provides further flexibility to modify the
configuration of your workspace without ejecting. Ejection will be re-enabled in a future
release of the CLI.

If you need to eject today, use CLI 1.7 to eject your project.

### Is there no equivalent to `$scope.emit()` or `$scope.broadcast()` in Angular?

There is no equivalent to `$scope.emit()` or `$scope.broadcast()` from AngularJS. EventEmitter inside of a component comes close, but it will only emit an event to the immediate parent component.

To communicate between siblings we could use:
1.  **Shared Application Model**: Siblings can communicate through a shared application model (just like angular 1). For example, when one sibling makes a change to a model, the other sibling that has bindings to the same model is automatically updated.
2.  **Component Events**: Child components can emit an event to the parent component using @Output() bindings. The parent component can handle the event, and manipulate the application model or it’s own view model. Changes to the Application Model are automatically propagated to all components that directly or indirectly bind to the same model.
3.  **Service Events**: Components can subscribe to service events. For example, two sibling components can subscribe to the same service event and respond by modifying their respective models. More on this below.

To communicate between a Root component and a component nested several levels deep we could use:
1.  **Shared Application Model**: The application model can be passed from the Root component down to deeply nested sub-components through @Input() bindings. Changes to a model from any component will automatically propagate to all components that share the same model.
2.  **Service Events**: You can also move the EventEmitter to a shared service, which allows any component to inject the service and subscribe to the event. That way, a Root component can call a service method (typically mutating the model), which in turn emits an event. Several layers down, a grand-child component which has also injected the service and subscribed to the same event, can handle it. Any event handler that changes a shared Application Model, will automatically propagate to all components that depend on it. This is probably the closest equivalent to `$scope.broadcast()` from Angular 1.

### Could you provide some particular examples of using ngZone?

There would be a lot of cases when you want to use `NgZone`, I can name two :
1. When you want something to run outside of Angular's change detection.
Lets say we want to do some calculation when user is scrolling and don't want you to run change detection, in this case, you'd use NgZone:

```js
constructor(private zone:NgZone){
   this.zone.runOutsideOfAngular(()=>{
      window.onscroll = ()=>{
       // do some heavy calculation : 
      }
    })
  }
```

2. The exact opposite of above, where you have a function that is somehow outside of Angular's zone and you want it to be inside, like when a third party library is doing some stuff for you and you want it to be bound to your Angular cycle.

```js
this.zone.run(()=>{
    $.get('someUrl').then(()=>{
        this.myViewVariable = "updated";
    })
});

### Name some differences between SystemJS vs WebPack?

**SystemJS**:
* SystemJS is known to be quirky with dependencies that it uses for its own polyfill
* Importing libraries/modules from npm is not as simple as it is using WebPack
* As you add dependencies and the code starts to grow, a fatal flaw of JSPM( systemjs) is revealed. It becomes extremely sluggish. A single refresh can take about 15-20 seconds as the browser will load 100s of different JavaScript files
* Gulp is still required for:
  * Minification
  * Envification (envify)
 * Generating unique hashname for bundle file

**WebPack**:
* Changes are now shown in milliseconds; Webpack’s dev server is designed for speed. Not only does it support incremental builds, it serves directly from memory
* You can easily import libraries from npm (e.g. Bootstrap or Foundation) without worrying about their exact path within node_modules
* No need of gulp. Webpack itself takes care of doing all the tasks that require Gulp in SystemJS
* It appears that Webpack was designed from the ground-up for large applications and it shows in the development process

### Why angular uses url segment?

A **UrlSegment** is a part of a URL between the two slashes. It contains a path and the _matrix parameters_ associated with the segment.

Matrix parameters are tied to a path segment, while query parameters are tied to the URL. They have different semantics. 

Consider:
```sh
localhost:3000/heroes;id=15;foo=foo/bar/baz
// instead of localhost:3000/heroes/bar/baz?id=15&foo=foo
```

The parameters are _tied to heroes_ no to the URL. When you access the route.url, you will see this

```js
this.route.url.subscribe((url: UrlSegment[]) => {
  let heroes = url[0];
  let heroesMatrix = heroes.parameters();
  // heroes should contain id=15, foo=foo
  let bar = url[1].path; // 15
  let baz = url[2].path; //foo
})
```
For matrix parameters you can also subscribe to params instead of peeling them out of url.
```js
this.paramSubscription = this.activeRoute.params.subscribe(params => {
  const bar = params['bar'];
  const baz = params['baz'];
});
```
With an Angular app, the only people who really care about these parameters are us the developer. The user doesn't care. It is not a REST API where we should stick to well known semantics. For out Angular app, as long as we the developer know how to use params (whether matrix or query), it shouldn't matter which one we use.

### When to use query parameters versus matrix parameters?

The differences between Matrix parameters and Query Parameters are much more than just convention.

The main differences are:

* urls with query params won't have their response cached by intermediaries/proxies (at present)
* matrix parameters may appear anywhere in path
* calculating the relative uri is different
* query params are generally abused to add new verbs instead of using existing methods on resources
* matrix parameters are not resources, they are aspects that help reference a resource in an information space that is difficult to represent within a hierarchy
