### What will be the output of the following HTML code

**Consider:**
```js
<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Nested item 2.1</li>
      <li>Nested item 2.2</li>
      <li>Nested item 2.3</li>
    </ul>     
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
What will be the output of the following HTML code?

**Answer:**

If we apply `.list-unstyled` to a list, it will remove the default list-style and left margin on the list items. But *only* for the immediate children. Main list items will be without any style, and nested list items will still have default unordered nested list-style.

### Explain why you prefer Bootstrap for website development?

Bootstrap has features that are way better than other web development platforms.
It provides an extensive browser support for almost every known browser such as
Opera, Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc. With adequate knowledge of CSS and HTML, web
development becomes easy on Bootstrap. Also, it supports mobile applications
with the help of responsive design. It can adjust CSS as per the device, screen
size etc. Instead of creating multiple files, it creates only a single file,
which reduces any extra effort by the developer.

### How many types of layout are available in Bootstrap?

There are two major layouts for Bootstrap i.e. Fluid Layout and Fixed Layout.
Fluid layout is necessary for creating an app that is 100 % wider and covers all

### Why do we use Jumbotron in Bootstrap?

*Jumbotron* has a very basic function in bootstrap i.e. highlighting a content. It
could either be a slogan/uvp (unique value proposition) or probably a headline. It increases the heading size
and gives a margin for content of the landing page. In order to implement
Jumbotron in a Bootstrap use:

```html
 <div class=”jumbotron”>
```

Jumbotron can have any valid HTML along with other functions and classes.

### What global styles are applied as a part of Bootstrap’s default typography?

Bootstrap sets the global default font-size to `14px`, with a line-height of `1.428`. The default font is changed to `Helvetica` and `Arial` with `sans serif` fallback. 

All these styles are applied to the `<body>` and all paragraphs, with the addition that `<p>` (paragraphs) receive a bottom margin of half their computed line-height, which is `10px` by default.

### What is the procedure to create Nav elements in Bootstrap?

There are several styling navigation elements available on bootstrap and every
style uses the same function i.e. class `.nav`. In order to create tabs or a

Halflings are not free and require licensing, however their creator has made
them available for Bootstrap projects free of cost.

To use the icons, simply use the following code just about anywhere in your
code. Leave a space between the icon and text for proper padding.

### How do you make images responsive?

Bootstrap 3 allows to make the images responsive by adding a class
`.img-responsive` to the `<img>` tag. This class applies `max-width: 100%;` and
`height: auto;` to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element.

### What is missing for a tooltip to show properly?

Consider:
```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Example tooltip">Hover over me</button>
```
What is missing for a tooltip to show properly?

**Answer**

Bootstrap’s Tooltip plugin is not CSS-only, like other plugins are. For performance reasons, the Tooltip plugin is opt-in, and to use it you must initialize it using JavaScript with the following example code:
```js
$(function () {
  $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip();
});
```

### What do you mean by Bootstrap collapsing elements?

Bootstrap collapsing elements is a way in which you can collapse any specific
element without developing any JavaScript code or even an accordion markup.  In order to implement this element, you need to add `data-toggle=”collapse”` in
controller element. 

To automatically assign the control of the collapsible
element, you can use `data-target` or `href` along with `data-toggle=”collapse”`.
There are other options also available such as `collapse
(‘hide’)`, `.collapse (‘show’)`.

the entire list and class `.list-group-item` to refer only to an individual item
in that list.

### Consider the HTML code snippet below. What will the output be, and why?

**Consider:**
```html
<div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-success" style="width: 65%">
    <span class="sr-only">65% sucesfuly completed</span>
  </div>
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-warning" style="width: 20%">
    <span class="sr-only">20% completed with warnings</span>
  </div>
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-danger" style="width: 15%">
    <span class="sr-only">15% did not complete</span>
  </div>
</div>
```
Consider the HTML code snippet below. What will the output be, and why?

**Answer**

By placing multiple bars under the same `.progress` parent element, Bootstrap will stack them into one single progress bar. Since the sum of the progress bar is 100%, the progress bar will be full width and fully populated.

### How can you differentiate between Bootstrap and Foundation?

Bootstrap supports LESS preprocessor and allows the designing and development
for both mobile and desktop. It uses only pixels and has a number of UI
elements. Foundation, on the other hand, supports Sass preprocessor and allows
mostly mobile designing. It uses REMs and has only a few options when it comes
to UI elements.

### How many different media queries are used by the Bootstrap grid system by default?

The Bootstrap grid system provides four tiers of classes: 
* `xs` for phones (<768px), 
* `sm` for tablets (≥768px), 
* `md` for desktops (≥992px), 
* `lg` for large desktops (≥1200px). 

The hidden trick in this question is that there are only three media queries. Bootstrap is mobile first by design, so the default styles are for small devices, and media queries are then added on for larger screens, as follow in LESS code:

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-md-min) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-lg-min) { ... }
```

### What is the class sr-only used for? Is it important or can I remove it?

According to bootstrap's documentation, the `sr-only` class is used to hide information intended only for screen readers from the layout of the rendered page. 

For example you might consider to hide from sighted user an internal link "skip to main content" which is desirable for blind users if you have a complex navigation or adds in the page header before the content. You should always consider screen readers for accessibility purposes. 

According to the World Health Organization, 285 million people have vision impairments. So making a website accessible is important.
