### What is JVM? Why is Java called the “Platform Independent Programming Language”? 

A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform.

### What is a Servlet?

The servlet is a Java programming language class used to process client requests and generate dynamic web content. Servlets are mostly used to process or store data submitted by an HTML form, provide dynamic content and manage state information that does not exist in the stateless HTTP protocol.

### What is a JSP Page?

A Java Server Page (JSP) is a text document that contains two types of text: static data and JSP elements. Static data can be expressed in any text-based format, such as HTML or XML. JSP is a technology that mixes static content with dynamically-generated content.

### Let's talk Swing. What is the difference between a Choice and a List?

A Choice is displayed in a compact form that must be pulled down, in order for a user to be able to see the list of all available choices. Only one item may be selected from a Choice. A List may be displayed in such a way that several List items are visible. A List supports the selection of one or more List items.

### What is the difference between an Applet and a Java Application?

Applets are executed within a java enabled browser, but a Java application is a standalone Java program that can be executed outside of a browser. However, they both require the existence of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Furthermore, a Java application requires a main method with a specific signature, in order to start its execution. Java applets don’t need such a method to start their execution. Finally, Java applets typically use a restrictive security policy, while Java applications usually use more relaxed security policies.

### What is the Difference between JDK and JRE? 

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is basically the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where your Java programs are being executed. It also includes browser plugins for applet execution. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured Software Development Kit for Java, including the JRE, the compilers and tools (like JavaDoc, and Java Debugger), in order for a user to develop, compile and execute Java applications.

### What are the two types of Exceptions in Java? Which are the differences between them? 

Java has two types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method or a constructor’s throws clause, if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or the constructor, and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary. On the other hand, checked exceptions must be declared in a method or a constructor’s throws clause. See here for tips on [Java exception handling](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/07/java-exception-handling-tutorial-with-examples-and-best-practices.html).

### Explain the architecture of a Servlet.

The core abstraction that must be implemented by all servlets is the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Each servlet must implement it either directly or indirectly, either by extending javax.servlet.GenericServlet or javax.servlet.http.HTTPServlet. Finally, each servlet is able to serve multiple requests in parallel using multithreading.

### What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class? 

Java provides and supports the creation both of [abstract classes](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-basics/java-abstract-class-example/) and interfaces. Both implementations share some common characteristics, but they differ in the following features:

* All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
* A class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.
* In order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.
* Abstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.
* Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
* Members of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public.
* An interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. An abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if it contains a main method.
*

### What are pass by reference and pass by value? 

When an object is passed by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed. Thus, even if changes are made to that object, it doesn’t affect the original value. When an object is passed by reference, this means that the actual object is not passed, rather a reference of the object is passed. Thus, any changes made by the external method, are also reflected in all places.

### What is the difference between processes and threads?

A process is an execution of a program, while a [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) is a single execution sequence within a process. A process can contain multiple threads. A [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) is sometimes called a lightweight process.

### Explain Serialization and Deserialization. 

Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented as a sequence of bytes and includes the object’s data, as well as information about the object’s type, and the types of data stored in the object. Thus, serialization can be seen as a way of flattening objects, in order to be stored on disk, and later, read back and reconstituted. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting an object from its flattened state to a live object.

### What are Expressions?

A JSP expression is used to insert the value of a scripting language expression, converted into a string, into the data stream returned to the client, by the web server. Expressions are defined between <% = and %> tags.

### What are Declarations?

Declarations are similar to variable declarations in Java. Declarations are used to declare variables for subsequent use in expressions or scriptlets. To add a declaration, you must use the sequences to enclose your declarations.

### What are JSP actions?

JSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. JSP actions are executed when a JSP page is requested. They can be dynamically inserted into a file, re-use JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate HTML for the Java plugin.Some of the available actions are listed below:

* jsp:include – includes a file, when the JSP page is requested.
* jsp:useBean – finds or instantiates a JavaBean.
* jsp:setProperty – sets the property of a JavaBean.
* jsp:getProperty – gets the property of a JavaBean.
* jsp:forward – forwards the requester to a new page.
* jsp:plugin – generates browser-specific code.

### What are Directives?

What are the different types of Directives available in JSP ? Directives are instructions that are processed by the JSP engine, when the page is compiled to a servlet. Directives are used to set page-level instructions, insert data from external files, and specify custom tag libraries. Directives are defined between < %@ and % >.The different types of directives are shown below:

* Include directive: it is used to include a file and merges the content of the file with the current page.
* Page directive: it is used to define specific attributes in the JSP page, like error page and buffer.
* Taglib: it is used to declare a custom tag library which is used in the page.

### How are the JSP requests handled?

On the arrival of a JSP request, the browser first requests a page with a .jsp extension. Then, the Web server reads the request and using the JSP compiler, the Web server converts the JSP page into a servlet class. Notice that the JSP file is compiled only on the first request of the page, or if the JSP file has changed.The generated servlet class is invoked, in order to handle the browser’s request. Once the execution of the request is over, the servlet sends a response back to the client. See [how to get Request parameters in a JSP](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/jsp/get-request-parameter-in-jsp-page/).

### What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework? 

[Java Collections Framework](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html) provides a well designed set of interfaces and classes that support operations on a collections of objects. The most basic interfaces that reside in the Java Collections Framework are:

* [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html), which represents a group of objects known as its elements.
* [Set](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html), which is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
* [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html), which is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements.
* [Map](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html), which is an object that maps keys to values and cannot contain duplicate keys.

### What does the “static” keyword mean? Can you override private or static method in Java?

The static keyword denotes that a member variable or method can be accessed, without requiring an instantiation of the class to which it belongs. A user cannot override static methods in Java, because method overriding is based upon dynamic binding at runtime and static methods are statically binded at compile time. A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable.

### What is an Iterator? 

The [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) interface provides a number of methods that are able to iterate over any [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html). Each Java [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) contains the [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  method that returns an [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  instance. Iterators are capable of removing elements from the underlying collection during the iteration.

### How HashMap works in Java? 

[A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/03/how-hashmap-works-in-java.html). The [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) are its capacity, its load factor and the threshold resizing.

### What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable? 

Both the [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) and [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) classes implement the Map interface and thus, have very similar characteristics. However, they differ in the following features:

* A [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) allows the existence of null keys and values, while a [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) doesn’t allow neither null keys, nor null values.
* A [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) is synchronized, while a [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is not. Thus, [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is preferred in single-threaded environments, while a [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) is suitable for multi-threaded environments.
* A [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) provides its set of keys and a Java application can iterate over them. Thus, a [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is fail-fast. On the other hand, a [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) provides an [Enumeration](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html) of its keys.
* The [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) class is considered to be a legacy class.

### What’s the difference between sendRedirect and forward methods?

The sendRedirect method creates a new request, while the forward method just forwards a request to a new target. The previous request scope objects are not available after a redirect, because it results in a new request. On the other hand, the previous request scope objects are available after forwarding. Finally, in general, the sendRedirect method is considered to be slower compare to the forward method.

### What do you know about the big-O notation and can you give some examples with respect to different data structures?

The Big-O notation simply describes how well an algorithm scales or performs in the worst case scenario as the number of elements in a data structure increases. The Big-O notation can also be used to describe other behavior such as memory consumption. Since the collection classes are actually data structures, we usually use the Big-O notation to chose the best implementation to use, based on time, memory and performance. Big-O notation can give a good indication about performance for large amounts of data.

### What are the Data Types supported by Java? What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?

The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:

* byte
* short
* int
* long
* float
* double
* boolean
* char

Autoboxing is [the automatic conversion made by the Java compiler](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/07/java-generics-tutorial-example-class-interface-methods-wildcards-and-much-more.html) between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, the compiler converts an int to an [Integer](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html?is-external=true), a double to a [Double](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html), and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this operation is called unboxing.

### What is Function Overriding and Overloading in Java?

Method overloading in Java occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the exact same name, but different parameters. On the other hand, method overriding is defined as the case when a child class redefines the same method as a parent class. Overridden methods must have the same name, argument list, and return type. The overriding method may not limit the access of the method it overrides.

### What is meant by a Web Application?

A Web application is a dynamic extension of a Web or application server. There are two types of web applications: presentation-oriented and service-oriented. A presentation-oriented Web application generates interactive web pages, which contain various types of markup language and dynamic content in response to requests. On the other hand, a service-oriented web application implements the endpoint of a web service. In general, a Web application can be seen as a collection of servlets installed under a specific subset of the server’s URL namespace.

### Why Collection doesn’t extend Cloneable and Serializable interfaces? 

The [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) interface specifies groups of objects known as elements. Each concrete implementation of a [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) can choose its own way of how to maintain and order its elements. Some collections allow duplicate keys, while some other collections don’t. The semantics and the implications of either cloning or serialization come into play when dealing with actual implementations. Thus, the concrete implementations of collections should decide how they can be cloned or serialized.

### What is the role of stub in RMI?

A stub for a remote object acts as a client’s local representative or proxy for the remote object. The caller invokes a method on the local stub, which is responsible for executing the method on the remote object. When a stub’s method is invoked, it undergoes the following steps:

* It initiates a connection to the remote JVM containing the remote object.
* It marshals the parameters to the remote JVM.
* It waits for the result of the method invocation and execution.
* It unmarshals the return value or an exception if the method has not been successfully executed.
* It returns the value to the caller.

### What is structure of Java Heap?

The JVM has a heap that is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. It is created at the JVM start-up. Heap memory for objects is reclaimed by an automatic memory management system which is known as a garbage collector. Heap memory consists of live and dead objects. Live objects are accessible by the application and will not be a subject of garbage collection. Dead objects are those which will never be accessible by the application, but have not been collected by the garbage collector yet. Such objects occupy the heap memory space until they are eventually collected by the garbage collector.

The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly raise a exception within the program. On the contrary, the `throws` clause is used to indicate those exceptions that are not handled by a method. Each method must explicitly specify which exceptions does not handle, so the callers of that method can guard against possible exceptions. Finally, multiple exceptions are separated by a comma.

### What’s the difference between Enumeration and Iterator interfaces? 

[Enumeration](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html) is twice as fast as compared to an Iterator and uses very less memory. However, the [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) is much safer compared to [Enumeration](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html), because other threads are not able to modify the collection object that is currently traversed by the iterator. Also, [Iterators](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection, something which is not possible with [Enumeration](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html).

### Can you access non static variable in static context?

A static variable in Java belongs to its class and its value remains the same for all its instances. A static variable is initialized when the class is loaded by the JVM. If your code tries to access a non-static variable, without any instance, the compiler will complain, because those variables are not created yet and they are not associated with any instance.

### What is the tradeoff between using an unordered array versus an ordered array? 

The major advantage of an ordered array is that the search times have time complexity of O(log n), compared to that of an unordered array, which is O (n). The disadvantage of an ordered array is that the insertion operation has a time complexity of O(n), because the elements with higher values must be moved to make room for the new element. Instead, the insertion operation for an unordered array takes constant time of O(1).

### What is a Constructor, Constructor Overloading in Java and Copy-Constructor? 

A constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class [has a constructor](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/01/which-is-better-option-cloning-or-copy-constructors.html). In case the programmer does not provide a constructor for a class, the Java compiler (Javac) creates a default constructor for that class. The constructor overloading is similar to method overloading in Java. Different constructors can be created for a single class. Each constructor must have its own unique parameter list. Finally, Java does support copy constructors like C++, but the difference lies in the fact that Java doesn’t create a default copy constructor if you don’t write your own.

### What is Java Priority Queue?

The [PriorityQueue](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html) is an unbounded queue, based on a priority heap and its elements are ordered in their natural order. At the time of its creation, we can provide a Comparator that is responsible for ordering the elements of the [PriorityQueue](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html). A [PriorityQueue](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html) doesn’t allow null values, those objects that doesn’t provide natural ordering, or those objects that don’t have any comparator associated with them. Finally, the Java [PriorityQueue](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html) is not thread-safe and it requires O(log(n)) time for its enqueuing and dequeing operations.

### What is Comparable and Comparator interface? List their differences.

Java provides the [Comparable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html) interface, which contains only one method, called [compareTo](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T)). This method compares two objects, in order to impose an order between them. Specifically, it returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer to indicate that the input object is less than, equal or greater than the existing object. Java provides the [Comparator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) interface, which contains two methods, called [compare](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare(T,%20T)) and [equals](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#equals(java.lang.Object)). The first method compares its two input arguments and imposes an order between them. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer to indicate that the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. The second method requires an object as a parameter and aims to decide whether the input object is equal to the comparator. The method returns true, only if the specified object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as the comparator.

### What is difference between ArrayList and LinkedList? 

Both the [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) and [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) classes implement the List interface, but they differ on the following features:

* An [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) is an index based data structure backed by an [Array](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Array.html). It provides random access to its elements with a performance equal to O(1). On the other hand, a [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) stores its data as list of elements and every element is linked to its previous and next element. In this case, the search operation for an element has execution time equal to O(n).
* The Insertion, addition and removal operations of an element are faster in a [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) compared to an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html), because there is no need of resizing an array or updating the index when an element is added in some arbitrary position inside the collection.
* A [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) consumes more memory than an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html), because every node in a [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) stores two references, one for its previous element and one for its next element.

### What is difference between Array and ArrayList? When will you use Array over ArrayList?

The Array and ArrayList classes differ on the following features:

* [Arrays](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html) have fixed size, while an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) is dynamic.
* An [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) provides more methods and features, such as addAll, removeAll, iterator, etc.
* For a list of primitive data types, the collections use autoboxing to reduce the coding effort. However, this approach makes them slower when working on fixed size primitive data types.

### What is the importance of hashCode() and equals() methods? 

A [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) in Java uses the hashCode and equals methods to determine the index of the key-value pair. These methods are also used when we request the value of a specific key. If these methods are not implemented correctly, two different keys might produce the same hash value and thus, will be considered as equal by the collection. Furthermore, these methods are also used to detect duplicates. Thus, the implementation of both methods is crucial to the accuracy and correctness of the [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html).

* The [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  can traverse a collection only in forward direction, while the [ListIterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html) can traverse a [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html) in both directions.
* The [ListIterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html) implements the [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  interface and contains extra functionality, such as adding an element, replacing an element, getting the index position for previous and next elements, etc

### What is the difference between doGet() and doPost()?

* **doGET**: The GET method appends the name-value pairs on the request’s URL. Thus, there is a limit on the number of characters and subsequently on the number of values that can be used in a client’s request. Furthermore, the values of the request are made visible and thus, sensitive information must not be passed in that way.       
* **doPOST**: The POST method overcomes the limit imposed by the GET request, by sending the values of the request inside its body. Also, there is no limitations on the number of values to be sent across. Finally, the sensitive information passed through a POST request is not visible to an external client.

### What is the difference between an Applet and a Servlet?

An Applet is a client side java program that runs within a Web browser on the client machine. On the other hand, a servlet is a server side component that runs on the web server.An applet can use the user interface classes, while a servlet does not have a user interface. Instead, a servlet waits for client’s HTTP requests and generates a response in every request.

### Explain different ways of creating a thread. Which one would you prefer and why?

There are three ways that can be used in order for a [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) to be created:

* A class may extend the [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) class.
* A class may implement the [Runnable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html) interface.
* An application can use the [Executor](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html) framework, in order to create a thread pool.

The [Runnable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html) interface is preferred, as it does not require an object to inherit the [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) class. In case your application design requires multiple inheritance, only interfaces can help you. Also, the thread pool is very efficient and can be implemented and used very easily.

### What is meant by JSP implicit objects and what are they?

JSP implicit objects are those Java objects that the JSP Container makes available to developers in each page. A developer can call them directly, without being explicitly declared. JSP Implicit Objects are also called pre-defined variables.The following objects are considered implicit in a JSP page:

* application
* page
* request
* response
* session
* exception
* out
* config
* pageContext

### What is RMI?

The Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) is a Java API that performs the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage collection. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) can also be seen as the process of activating a method on a remotely running object. RMI offers location transparency because a user feels that a method is executed on a locally running object.

### Explain the available thread states in a high-level.

During its execution, a thread can reside in one of the following states:

* Runnable: A thread becomes ready to run, but does not necessarily start running immediately.
* Running: The processor is actively executing the thread code.
* Waiting: A thread is in a blocked state waiting for some external processing to finish.
* Sleeping: The thread is forced to sleep.
* Blocked on I/O: Waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
* Blocked on Synchronization: Waiting to acquire a lock.
* Dead: The thread has finished its execution.

### Explain Marshalling and demarshalling.

When an application wants to pass its memory objects across a network to another host or persist it to storage, the in-memory representation must be converted to a suitable format. This process is called marshalling and the revert operation is called demarshalling.

### How do you ensure that N threads can access N resources without deadlock? 

A very simple way to avoid deadlock while using N threads is to impose an ordering on the locks and force each thread to follow that ordering. Thus, if all threads lock and unlock the mutexes in the same order, no deadlocks can arise.

### What is Perm Gen space in Heap?

Perm Gen stands for permanent generation. It is the space on Java Heap that holds meta-data describing user classes (classes that are not part of the Java language). Examples of such meta-data are objects describing classes and methods and they are stored in the Permanent Generation. Applications with large code-base can quickly fill up this segment of the heap which will cause ```java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen``` no matter how high your ```-Xmx``` (maximum size of the memory allocation pool) and how much memory you have on the machine.

### What does Connection pooling mean?

The interaction with a database can be costly, regarding the opening and closing of database connections. Especially, when the number of database clients increases, this cost is very high and a large number of resources is consumed.A pool of database connections is obtained at start up by the application server and is maintained in a pool. A request for a connection is served by [a connection residing in the pool](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/hibernate/hibernate-connection-pool-configuration-with-c3p0-example/). In the end of the connection, the request is returned to the pool and can be used to satisfy future requests.

### What is the applet class loader, and what does it provide?

When an applet is loaded over the internet, the applet is loaded by the applet classloader. The class loader enforces the Java name space hierarchy. Also, the class loader guarantees that a unique namespace exists for classes that come from the local file system, and that a unique namespace exists for each network source. When a browser loads an applet over the net, that applet’s classes are placed in a private namespace associated with the applet’s origin. Then, those classes loaded by the class loader are passed through the verifier.The verifier checks that the class file conforms to the Java language specification . Among other things, the verifier ensures that there are no stack overflows or underflows and that the parameters to all bytecode instructions are correct.

###  What is the difference between applets loaded over the internet and applets loaded via the file system?

Regarding the case where an applet is loaded over the internet, the applet is loaded by the applet classloader and is subject to the restrictions enforced by the applet security manager. Regarding the case where an applet is loaded from the client’s local disk, the applet is loaded by the file system loader. Applets loaded via the file system are allowed to read files, write files and to load libraries on the client. Also, applets loaded via the file system are allowed to execute processes and finally, applets loaded via the file system are not passed through the byte code verifier.

### What is Servlet Chaining?

Servlet Chaining is the method where the output of one servlet is sent to a second servlet. The output of the second servlet can be sent to a third servlet, and so on. The last servlet in the chain is responsible for sending the response to the client.

### How do you find out what client machine is making a request to your servlet?

The ServletRequest class has functions for finding out the IP address or host name of the client machine. getRemoteAddr() gets the IP address of the client machine and getRemoteHost() gets the host name of the client machine. See example [here](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/servlet/get-client-s-address-and-hostname-in-servlet/).

### What are some of the best practices relating to the Java Collection framework?

* Choosing the right type of the collection to use, based on the application’s needs, is very crucial for its performance. For example if the size of the elements is fixed and know a priori, we shall use an [Array](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Array.html), instead of an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html).
* Some collection classes allow us to specify their initial capacity. Thus, if we have an estimation on the number of elements that will be stored, we can use it to avoid rehashing or resizing.
* Always use Generics for type-safety, readability, and robustness. Also, by using Generics you avoid the [ClassCastException](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html) during runtime.
* Use immutable classes provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) as a key in a Map, in order to avoid the implementation of the [hashCode](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode%28%29) and equals methods for our custom class.
* Program in terms of interface not implementation.
* Return zero-length collections or arrays as opposed to returning a null in case the underlying collection is actually empty.

### What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?

In Java programming, each object has a lock. A thread can acquire the lock for an object by using the synchronized keyword. The synchronized keyword can be applied in a method level (coarse grained lock) or block level of code (fine grained lock).

### What is the basic principle of RMI architecture?

The RMI architecture is based on a very important principle which states that the definition of the behavior and the implementation of that behavior, are separate concepts. RMI allows the code that defines the behavior and the code that implements the behavior to remain separate and to run on separate JVMs.

### What is the purpose of using RMISecurityManager in RMI?

RMISecurityManager provides a security manager that can be used by RMI applications, which use downloaded code. The class loader of RMI will not download any classes from remote locations, if the security manager has not been set.

### What is the role of Remote Interface in RMI?

The Remote interface serves to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked from a non-local virtual machine. Any object that is a remote object must directly or indirectly implement this interface. A class that implements a remote interface should declare the remote interfaces being implemented, define the constructor for each remote object and provide an implementation for each remote method in all remote interfaces.

### What is the difference between Serial and Throughput Garbage collector?

The throughput garbage collector uses a parallel version of the young generation collector and is meant to be used with applications that have medium to large data sets. On the other hand, the serial collector is usually adequate for most small applications (those requiring heaps of up to approximately 100MB on modern processors).

### What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?

The [HashSet](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html) is Implemented using a hash table and thus, its elements are not ordered. The add, remove, and contains methods of a [HashSet](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html)  have constant time complexity O(1). On the other hand, a [TreeSet](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html) is implemented using a tree structure. The elements in a [TreeSet](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html) are sorted, and thus, the add, remove, and contains methods have time complexity of O(log n).

### Does Garbage collection occur in permanent generation space in JVM?

Garbage Collection does occur in PermGen space and if PermGen space is full or cross a threshold, it can trigger a full garbage collection. If you look carefully at the output of the garbage collector, you will find that PermGen space is also garbage collected. This is the reason why correct sizing of PermGen space is important to avoid frequent full garbage collections.

### What is DGC ? And how does it work?

DGC stands for Distributed Garbage Collection. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) uses DGC for automatic garbage collection. Since RMI involves remote object references across JVM’s, garbage collection can be quite difficult. DGC uses a reference counting algorithm to provide automatic memory management for remote objects.

### What are the layers of RMI Architecture?

The RMI architecture consists of the following layers:

* Stub and Skeleton layer: This layer lies just beneath the view of the developer. This layer is responsible for intercepting method calls made by the client to the interface and redirect these calls to a remote RMI Service.
* Remote Reference Layer: The second layer of the RMI architecture deals with the interpretation of references made from the client to the server’s remote objects. This layer interprets and manages references made from clients to the remote service objects. The connection is a one-to-one (unicast) link.
* Transport layer: This layer is responsible for connecting the two JVM participating in the service. This layer is based on TCP/IP connections between machines in a network. It provides basic connectivity, as well as some firewall penetration strategies.

### How does thread synchronization occurs inside a monitor? What levels of synchronization can you apply? 

The JVM uses locks in conjunction with monitors. A monitor is basically a guardian that watches over a sequence of synchronized code and ensuring that only one thread at a time executes a synchronized piece of code. Each monitor is associated with an object reference. The thread is not allowed to execute the code until it obtains the lock.
