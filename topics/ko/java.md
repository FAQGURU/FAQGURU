### JVM이란 무엇입니까? Java를 "플랫폼 독립 프로그래밍 언어"라고 부르는 이유는 무엇입니까?

A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a process virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform.

### 애플릿과 자바 애플리케이션의 차이점은 무엇입니까?

Applets are executed within a java enabled browser, but a Java application is a standalone Java program that can be executed outside of a browser. However, they both require the existence of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Furthermore, a Java application requires a main method with a specific signature, in order to start its execution. Java applets don’t need such a method to start their execution. Finally, Java applets typically use a restrictive security policy, while Java applications usually use more relaxed security policies.

### Java의 두 가지 예외 유형은 무엇입니까? 이들의 차이점은 무엇인가요?

Java has two types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method or a constructor’s throws clause, if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or the constructor, and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary. On the other hand, checked exceptions must be declared in a method or a constructor’s throws clause. See here for tips on [Java exception handling](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/07/java-exception-handling-tutorial-with-examples-and-best-practices.html).

### 서블릿의 아키텍처를 설명합니다.

The core abstraction that must be implemented by all servlets is the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Each servlet must implement it either directly or indirectly, either by extending javax.servlet.GenericServlet or javax.servlet.http.HTTPServlet. Finally, each servlet is able to serve multiple requests in parallel using multithreading.

### 인터페이스와 추상 클래스의 차이점은 무엇입니까?

Java provides and supports the creation both of [abstract classes](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-basics/java-abstract-class-example/) and interfaces. Both implementations share some common characteristics, but they differ in the following features:

* All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
* A class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.
* In order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.
* Abstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.
* Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
* Members of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public.
* An interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. An abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if it contains a main method.
*

### 참조에 의한 전달과 값에 의한 전달이란 무엇입니까?

When an object is passed by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed. Thus, even if changes are made to that object, it doesn’t affect the original value. When an object is passed by reference, this means that the actual object is not passed, rather a reference of the object is passed. Thus, any changes made by the external method, are also reflected in all places.

### 직렬화와 역직렬화에 대해 설명합니다.

Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented as a sequence of bytes and includes the object’s data, as well as information about the object’s type, and the types of data stored in the object. Thus, serialization can be seen as a way of flattening objects, in order to be stored on disk, and later, read back and reconstituted. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting an object from its flattened state to a live object.

### JSP 작업이란 무엇입니까?

JSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. JSP actions are executed when a JSP page is requested. They can be dynamically inserted into a file, re-use JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate HTML for the Java plugin.Some of the available actions are listed below:

* jsp:include – includes a file, when the JSP page is requested.
* jsp:useBean – finds or instantiates a JavaBean.
* jsp:setProperty – sets the property of a JavaBean.
* jsp:getProperty – gets the property of a JavaBean.
* jsp:forward – forwards the requester to a new page.
* jsp:plugin – generates browser-specific code.

### 지시문이란 무엇입니까?

What are the different types of Directives available in JSP ? Directives are instructions that are processed by the JSP engine, when the page is compiled to a servlet. Directives are used to set page-level instructions, insert data from external files, and specify custom tag libraries. Directives are defined between < %@ and % >.The different types of directives are shown below:

* Include directive: it is used to include a file and merges the content of the file with the current page.
* Page directive: it is used to define specific attributes in the JSP page, like error page and buffer.
* Taglib: it is used to declare a custom tag library which is used in the page.

### JSP 요청은 어떻게 처리됩니까?

On the arrival of a JSP request, the browser first requests a page with a .jsp extension. Then, the Web server reads the request and using the JSP compiler, the Web server converts the JSP page into a servlet class. Notice that the JSP file is compiled only on the first request of the page, or if the JSP file has changed.The generated servlet class is invoked, in order to handle the browser’s request. Once the execution of the request is over, the servlet sends a response back to the client. See [how to get Request parameters in a JSP](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/jsp/get-request-parameter-in-jsp-page/).

### Java Collection Framework의 기본 인터페이스는 무엇입니까?

[Java Collections Framework](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html) provides a well designed set of interfaces and classes that support operations on a collections of objects. The most basic interfaces that reside in the Java Collections Framework are:

* [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html), which represents a group of objects known as its elements.
* [Set](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html), which is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
* [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html), which is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements.
* [Map](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html), which is an object that maps keys to values and cannot contain duplicate keys.

### "정적" 키워드는 무엇을 의미합니까? Java에서 개인 또는 정적 메소드를 재정의할 수 있습니까?

The static keyword denotes that a member variable or method can be accessed, without requiring an instantiation of the class to which it belongs. A user cannot override static methods in Java, because method overriding is based upon dynamic binding at runtime and static methods are statically binded at compile time. A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable.

### 반복자 란 무엇입니까?

The [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) interface provides a number of methods that are able to iterate over any [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html). Each Java [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) contains the [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  method that returns an [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  instance. Iterators are capable of removing elements from the underlying collection during the iteration.

### HashMap은 Java에서 어떻게 작동합니까?

[A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/03/how-hashmap-works-in-java.html). The [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) are its capacity, its load factor and the threshold resizing.

### HashMap과 Hashtable 사이에는 어떤 차이점이 있습니까?

Both the [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) and [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) classes implement the Map interface and thus, have very similar characteristics. However, they differ in the following features:

* A [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) allows the existence of null keys and values, while a [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) doesn’t allow neither null keys, nor null values.
* A [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) is synchronized, while a [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is not. Thus, [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is preferred in single-threaded environments, while a [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) is suitable for multi-threaded environments.
* A [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) provides its set of keys and a Java application can iterate over them. Thus, a [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is fail-fast. On the other hand, a [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) provides an [Enumeration](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html) of its keys.
* The [Hashtable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) class is considered to be a legacy class.

### Big-O 표기법에 대해 무엇을 알고 있으며 다른 데이터 구조와 관련하여 몇 가지 예를 제공할 수 있습니까?

The Big-O notation simply describes how well an algorithm scales or performs in the worst case scenario as the number of elements in a data structure increases. The Big-O notation can also be used to describe other behavior such as memory consumption. Since the collection classes are actually data structures, we usually use the Big-O notation to chose the best implementation to use, based on time, memory and performance. Big-O notation can give a good indication about performance for large amounts of data.

### Java에서 지원하는 데이터 유형은 무엇입니까? 오토박싱과 언박싱이란?

The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:

* byte
* short
* int
* long
* float
* double
* boolean
* char

Autoboxing is [the automatic conversion made by the Java compiler](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/07/java-generics-tutorial-example-class-interface-methods-wildcards-and-much-more.html) between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, the compiler converts an int to an [Integer](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html?is-external=true), a double to a [Double](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html), and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this operation is called unboxing.

### Collection이 Cloneable 및 Serializable 인터페이스를 확장하지 않는 이유는 무엇입니까?

Each concrete implementation of a [Collection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) can choose its own way of how to maintain and order its elements. Some collections allow duplicate keys, while some other collections don’t. The semantics and the implications of either cloning or serialization come into play when dealing with actual implementations. Thus, the concrete implementations of collections should decide how they can be cloned or serialized.

A stub for a remote object acts as a client’s local representative or proxy for the remote object. The caller invokes a method on the local stub, which is responsible for executing the method on the remote object. When a stub’s method is invoked, it undergoes the following steps:

* It initiates a connection to the remote JVM containing the remote object.
* It marshals the parameters to the remote JVM.
* It waits for the result of the method invocation and execution.
* It unmarshals the return value or an exception if the method has not been successfully executed.
* It returns the value to the caller.

### Java 힙의 구조는 무엇입니까?

The JVM has a heap that is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. It is created at the JVM start-up. Heap memory for objects is reclaimed by an automatic memory management system which is known as a garbage collector. Heap memory consists of live and dead objects. Live objects are accessible by the application and will not be a subject of garbage collection. Dead objects are those which will never be accessible by the application, but have not been collected by the garbage collector yet. Such objects occupy the heap memory space until they are eventually collected by the garbage collector.

### 정렬되지 않은 배열과 정렬된 배열을 사용하는 것 사이의 절충점은 무엇입니까? 

The major advantage of an ordered array is that the search times have time complexity of O(log n), compared to that of an unordered array, which is O (n). The disadvantage of an ordered array is that the insertion operation has a time complexity of O(n), because the elements with higher values must be moved to make room for the new element. Instead, the insertion operation for an unordered array takes constant time of O(1).

### 생성자, Java 및 복사 생성자의 생성자 오버로딩이란 무엇입니까?

A constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class [has a constructor](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/01/which-is-better-option-cloning-or-copy-constructors.html). In case the programmer does not provide a constructor for a class, the Java compiler (Javac) creates a default constructor for that class. The constructor overloading is similar to method overloading in Java. Different constructors can be created for a single class. Each constructor must have its own unique parameter list. Finally, Java does support copy constructors like C++, but the difference lies in the fact that Java doesn’t create a default copy constructor if you don’t write your own.

### Comparable 및 Comparator 인터페이스란 무엇입니까? 차이점을 나열하십시오.

Java provides the [Comparable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html) interface, which contains only one method, called [compareTo](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T)). This method compares two objects, in order to impose an order between them. Specifically, it returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer to indicate that the input object is less than, equal or greater than the existing object. Java provides the [Comparator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) interface, which contains two methods, called [compare](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare(T,%20T)) and [equals](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#equals(java.lang.Object)). The first method compares its two input arguments and imposes an order between them. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer to indicate that the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. The second method requires an object as a parameter and aims to decide whether the input object is equal to the comparator. The method returns true, only if the specified object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as the comparator.

### ArrayList와 LinkedList의 차이점은 무엇입니까?

Both the [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) and [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) classes implement the List interface, but they differ on the following features:

* An [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) is an index based data structure backed by an [Array](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Array.html). It provides random access to its elements with a performance equal to O(1). On the other hand, a [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) stores its data as list of elements and every element is linked to its previous and next element. In this case, the search operation for an element has execution time equal to O(n).
* The Insertion, addition and removal operations of an element are faster in a [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) compared to an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html), because there is no need of resizing an array or updating the index when an element is added in some arbitrary position inside the collection.
* A [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) consumes more memory than an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html), because every node in a [LinkedList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) stores two references, one for its previous element and one for its next element.

* [Arrays](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html) have fixed size, while an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) is dynamic.
* An [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) provides more methods and features, such as addAll, removeAll, iterator, etc.
* For a list of primitive data types, the collections use autoboxing to reduce the coding effort. However, this approach makes them slower when working on fixed size primitive data types.

### hashCode() 및 equals() 메서드의 중요성은 무엇입니까?

These methods are also used when we request the value of a specific key. If these methods are not implemented correctly, two different keys might produce the same hash value and thus, will be considered as equal by the collection. Furthermore, these methods are also used to detect duplicates. Thus, the implementation of both methods is crucial to the accuracy and correctness of the [HashMap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html).

### Iterator와 ListIterator에는 어떤 차이점이 있습니까?

The differences of these elements are listed below:

* An [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  can be used to traverse the [Set](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html) and [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html)  collections, while the [ListIterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html) can be used to iterate only over [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html) .
* The [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  can traverse a collection only in forward direction, while the [ListIterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html) can traverse a [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html) in both directions.
* The [ListIterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html) implements the [Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)  interface and contains extra functionality, such as adding an element, replacing an element, getting the index position for previous and next elements, etc

A [CallableStatement](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/CallableStatement.html) is used to execute stored procedures. Stored procedures are stored and offered by a database. Stored procedures may take input values from the user and may return a result. The usage of stored procedures is highly encouraged, because it offers security and modularity.The method that prepares a [CallableStatement](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/CallableStatement.html) is the following:

```java
CallableStament.prepareCall();
```

### doGet()과 doPost()의 차이점은 무엇입니까?

* **doGET**: The GET method appends the name-value pairs on the request’s URL. Thus, there is a limit on the number of characters and subsequently on the number of values that can be used in a client’s request. Furthermore, the values of the request are made visible and thus, sensitive information must not be passed in that way.       
* **doPOST**: The POST method overcomes the limit imposed by the GET request, by sending the values of the request inside its body. Also, there is no limitations on the number of values to be sent across. Finally, the sensitive information passed through a POST request is not visible to an external client.

### 서블릿의 생명주기를 설명하라.

On every client’s request, the Servlet Engine loads the servlets and invokes its init methods, in order for the servlet to be initialized. Then, the Servlet object handles all subsequent requests coming from that client, by invoking the service method for each request separately. Finally, the servlet is removed by calling the server’s destroy method.

### 스레드를 생성하는 다양한 방법을 설명합니다. 어느 것을 선호하고 그 이유는 무엇입니까?

There are three ways that can be used in order for a [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) to be created:

* A class may extend the [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) class.
* A class may implement the [Runnable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html) interface.
* An application can use the [Executor](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html) framework, in order to create a thread pool.

The [Runnable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html) interface is preferred, as it does not require an object to inherit the [Thread](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html) class. In case your application design requires multiple inheritance, only interfaces can help you. Also, the thread pool is very efficient and can be implemented and used very easily.

### RMI 란 무엇입니까?

The Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) is a Java API that performs the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage collection. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) can also be seen as the process of activating a method on a remotely running object. RMI offers location transparency because a user feels that a method is executed on a locally running object.

### 힙에서 Perm Gen 공간이란 무엇입니까?

Perm Gen stands for permanent generation. It is the space on Java Heap that holds meta-data describing user classes (classes that are not part of the Java language). Examples of such meta-data are objects describing classes and methods and they are stored in the Permanent Generation. Applications with large code-base can quickly fill up this segment of the heap which will cause ```java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen``` no matter how high your ```-Xmx``` (maximum size of the memory allocation pool) and how much memory you have on the machine.

Especially, when the number of database clients increases, this cost is very high and a large number of resources is consumed.A pool of database connections is obtained at start up by the application server and is maintained in a pool. A request for a connection is served by [a connection residing in the pool](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/hibernate/hibernate-connection-pool-configuration-with-c3p0-example/). In the end of the connection, the request is returned to the pool and can be used to satisfy future requests.

### 애플릿 클래스 로더는 무엇이며 무엇을 제공합니까?

When an applet is loaded over the internet, the applet is loaded by the applet classloader. The class loader enforces the Java name space hierarchy. Also, the class loader guarantees that a unique namespace exists for classes that come from the local file system, and that a unique namespace exists for each network source. When a browser loads an applet over the net, that applet’s classes are placed in a private namespace associated with the applet’s origin. Then, those classes loaded by the class loader are passed through the verifier.The verifier checks that the class file conforms to the Java language specification . Among other things, the verifier ensures that there are no stack overflows or underflows and that the parameters to all bytecode instructions are correct.

###  인터넷을 통해 로드된 애플릿과 파일 시스템을 통해 로드된 애플릿의 차이점은 무엇입니까?

Regarding the case where an applet is loaded over the internet, the applet is loaded by the applet classloader and is subject to the restrictions enforced by the applet security manager. Regarding the case where an applet is loaded from the client’s local disk, the applet is loaded by the file system loader. Applets loaded via the file system are allowed to read files, write files and to load libraries on the client. Also, applets loaded via the file system are allowed to execute processes and finally, applets loaded via the file system are not passed through the byte code verifier.

### Java Collection 프레임워크와 관련된 모범 사례는 무엇입니까?

* Choosing the right type of the collection to use, based on the application’s needs, is very crucial for its performance. For example if the size of the elements is fixed and know a priori, we shall use an [Array](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Array.html), instead of an [ArrayList](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html).
* Some collection classes allow us to specify their initial capacity. Thus, if we have an estimation on the number of elements that will be stored, we can use it to avoid rehashing or resizing.
* Always use Generics for type-safety, readability, and robustness. Also, by using Generics you avoid the [ClassCastException](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html) during runtime.
* Use immutable classes provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) as a key in a Map, in order to avoid the implementation of the [hashCode](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode%28%29) and equals methods for our custom class.
* Program in terms of interface not implementation.
* Return zero-length collections or arrays as opposed to returning a null in case the underlying collection is actually empty.

### JVM의 영구 생성 공간에서 Garbage Collection이 발생합니까?

Garbage Collection does occur in PermGen space and if PermGen space is full or cross a threshold, it can trigger a full garbage collection. If you look carefully at the output of the garbage collector, you will find that PermGen space is also garbage collected. This is the reason why correct sizing of PermGen space is important to avoid frequent full garbage collections.

### DGC 란 무엇입니까? 어떻게 작동합니까??

DGC stands for Distributed Garbage Collection. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) uses DGC for automatic garbage collection. Since RMI involves remote object references across JVM’s, garbage collection can be quite difficult. DGC uses a reference counting algorithm to provide automatic memory management for remote objects.

### RMI 아키텍처의 계층은 무엇입니까?

The RMI architecture consists of the following layers:

* Stub and Skeleton layer: This layer lies just beneath the view of the developer. This layer is responsible for intercepting method calls made by the client to the interface and redirect these calls to a remote RMI Service.
* Remote Reference Layer: The second layer of the RMI architecture deals with the interpretation of references made from the client to the server’s remote objects. This layer interprets and manages references made from clients to the remote service objects. The connection is a one-to-one (unicast) link.
* Transport layer: This layer is responsible for connecting the two JVM participating in the service. This layer is based on TCP/IP connections between machines in a network. It provides basic connectivity, as well as some firewall penetration strategies.

### 스레드 동기화는 모니터 내부에서 어떻게 발생합니까? 어떤 수준의 동기화를 적용할 수 있습니까?

The JVM uses locks in conjunction with monitors. A monitor is basically a guardian that watches over a sequence of synchronized code and ensuring that only one thread at a time executes a synchronized piece of code. Each monitor is associated with an object reference. The thread is not allowed to execute the code until it obtains the lock.
