### Why Ruby is known as a language of flexibility?

Ruby is known as a language of flexibility because it facilitates its author to alter the programming elements. Some specific parts of the language can be removed or redefined. Ruby does not restrict the user. For example, to add two numbers, Ruby allows to use `+` sign or the word `plus`. This alteration can be done with Ruby's built-in class Numeric.

### What is an object?

An instance of a class. To some, it's also the root class in ruby (Object). Classes themselves descend from the Object root class.

### What is a class?

Classes hold **data**, have **methods** that interact with that data, and are used to **instantiate objects**.

```ruby
class WhatAreClasses
  def initialize
    @data = "I'm instance data of this object. Hello."
  end

  def method
    puts @data.gsub("instance", "altered")
  end
end

object = WhatAreClasses.new
object.method
 #=> I'm altered data of this object. Hello.
```

### Why are symbols typically used as hash keys instead of strings?

Strings are *mutable* while symbols are *immutable*. Though Ruby internally makes an immutable copy of a string when used as a hash key, comparing two symbols is faster than comparing two `String` objects. This is also a convention.

### How might you specify a default value for a hash? 

Pass the default values as arguments to `::new` on initialization or change the default directly with the method `Hash#default`. You may also provide a default at the time of query with `Hash#fetch`.

### What is the difference between nil and false in Ruby?

**nil**:
* nil cannot be a value
* nil is returned where there is no predicate
* nil is not a boolean data type
* nil is an object of nilclass

**false**:
* false can be a value
* in case of a predicate, true or false is returned by a method
* false is a boolean data type
* false is an object of falseclass

### Can you call a private method outside a Ruby class using its object?

Yes, with the help of the `send` method.

Given the class `Test`:
```ruby
class Test
   private
       def method
         p "I am a private method"
      end
end
```
    
We can execute the private method using `send`:

```ruby
>> Test.new.send(:method)
"I am a private method"
```

### What will be the values of ...

*   var1 will be equal to `nil`
*   var2 will be equal to `4`

A conditional statement in Ruby is an expression that returns `nil` if the conditional is `false`.  Ruby methods return the last expression in the method body.

### Explain each of the following operators and how and when they should be used

* `==` – Checks if the _value_ of two operands are equal (often overridden to provide a class-specific definition of equality).

* `===` – Specifically used to test equality within the `when` clause of a `case` statement (also often overridden to provide meaningful class-specific semantics in case statements).

* `eql?` – Checks if the _value_ and _type_ of two operands are the same (as opposed to the `==` operator which compares values but ignores types). For example, `1 == 1.0` evaluates to `true`, whereas `1.eql?(1.0)` evaluates to `false`.

* `equal?` – Compares the `identity` of two objects; i.e., returns `true` iff both operands have the same object id (i.e., if they both refer to the _same object_). Note that this will return `false` when comparing two identical _copies_ of the same object.

### Write a function that sorts the keys in a hash by the length of the key as a string.

As is always true in programming, there are in fact multiple ways to accomplish this.
The most straightforward answer would be of the form:
```ruby
hsh.keys.map(&:to_s).sort_by(&:length)
```    
or:
```ruby
hsh.keys.collect(&:to_s).sort_by { |key| key.length }
```

Alternatively, Ruby’s [`Enumerable` mixin](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html) provides many methods to operate on collections. The key here is to turn the hash keys into a collection, convert them all to strings, then sort the array.

```ruby
def key_sort hsh
   hsh.keys.collect(&:to_s).sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }
end
```

An equivalent call of the [`collect` method](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_iterators.htm) is done with the usual block syntax of:

```ruby
collect { |x| x.to_s }
```

### Which of the expressions listed below will result in "false"?

In Ruby, the _only_ values that evaluate to false are `false` and `nil`. _Everything else_ – even zero (0) and an empty array (\[\]) – evaluates to true.

This comes as a real surprise to programmers who have previously been working in other languages like JavaScript.

### Why might you use `#each` instead of `for/in`?  

It's the "Ruby way" - an example of how Ruby defines methods that mimic natural language concepts. Iterator methods such as `#each` read more naturally. `#each` is a block so it defines a new variable scope. `for/in` depends on the existence of `#each` which implies that `#each` is a more fundamental aspect of the language.

 #=> 282660

### What is a module?  Can you tell me the difference between classes and modules?

Modules serve as a mechanism for **namespaces**.

```ruby
module ANamespace
  class AClass
    def initialize
      puts "Another object, coming right up!"
    end
  end
end

ANamespace::AClass.new
 #=> Another object, coming right up!
```

Also, modules provide as a mechanism for multiple inheritance via **mix-ins** and **cannot be instantiated** like classes can.

```ruby
module AMixIn
  def who_am_i?
    puts "An existentialist, that's who."
  end
end

# String is already the parent class
class DeepString < String
  # extend adds instance methods from AMixIn as class methods
  extend AMixIn
end

DeepString.who_am_i?
 #=> An existentialist, that's who.

AMixIn.new
 #=> NoMethodError: undefined method ‘new’ for AMixIn:Module
```

### What is a DSL and how does it pertain to Ruby?  

A **Domain Specific Language** is an API that allows a developer to solve a problem or represent data more naturally than they might otherwise. The flexible nature of Ruby's syntax and the ability to alias and alter existing methods and classes makes it conducive to creating rich DSL's.

### What is duck typing and how does it pertain to Ruby?  

That an object may be acted upon even if it isn't the expected type as long as it looks and behaves like the expected object. This is a characteristic of Ruby because the lack of type checking of parameters makes this an effective programming technique.

=> false

> 5.between?(1, 10)

### What is the difference between private and protected methods?  

A private method can only be called by any instance methods of the defining class or any subclasses and must be invoked in a functional style and not explicitly on `self` such as with `self.my_method`. A protected method may be explicitly invoked by any instance of the defining class, and is not restricted to implicit invocation on `self`.

### What does it mean to coerce an object? Why would you do it?  

To *coerce an object* means to force it into an expected type. One might do this in order to try and force an unknown object type into the expected type or format required by the operation. This is a common practice involved in *duck typing*.

### What will val1 and val2 equal after the code below is executed? Explain your answer.

Although these two statements might appear to be equivalent, they are not, due to the order of operations. Specifically, the `and` and `or` operators have _lower_ precedence than the `=` operator, whereas the `&&` and `||` operators have _higher_ precedence than the `=` operator, based on order of operations.

To help clarify this, here’s the same code, but employing parentheses to clarify the default order of operations:

```ruby
(val1 = true) and false    # results in val1 being equal to true
val2 = (true && false)     # results in val2 being equal to false
```

This is, incidentally, a great example of why using parentheses to clearly specify your intent is generally a good practice, in any language. But whether or not you use parentheses, it’s important to be aware of these order of operations rules and to thereby ensure that you are properly determining when to employ `and` / `or` vs. `&&` / `||`.

### Explain redo vs. retry usage

`redo` and `retry` are both used to re-execute parts of a loop. But they differ in how much they re-execute: 
* `redo` only repeats the current iteration, while 
* `retry` repeats the whole loop from the start.

### Why might you want to avoid using string literals within loops?  

A new object is created for every string literal even when the values are identical. Consider using variables or symbols instead.

### What is the difference between Proc invocation and lambda invocation?  

A block must be associated with lambda invocation. Lambdas must be invoked with the exact number of arguments such as is required by method invocation, whereas procs are more flexible in receiving arguments.

###  What is the main difference between procs and lambdas?

Calling a lambda is more akin to invoking a method where a return statement in a lambda will return from the lambda itself, instead of returning from the lexically enclosing method, as procs do. Adding to this notion, lambdas must be invoked with the exact number of arguments such as is required by method invocation, whereas procs are more flexible in receiving arguments.

### Why can you safely use a string as a hash key, even though a string is mutable? 

Because the interpreter makes a private copy of a string used as a hash key.

### What will be the value of ...

```ruby
defined? foo
#=> "local-variable"
defined? bar
#=> nil

`foo` has been at least read by the interpreter, therefore it is defined and assigned a `nil` value. However, since `bar` has never been written, it was never defined in the first place.

### What is the value of the variable "upcased" in the below piece of code?

Let’s take a look at `puts` as below:

```ruby
>> puts "Hi"
Hi
=> nil
```

Note the `nil` at the end: that’s the return value from `puts`. After all, `puts` is a `method`, so it has to return something. As it happens, it always returns `nil`. The printing out of the string is an action the method performs.

Similarly, evaluating the code in question we can understand that while it’s a common learner mistake to expect the result to be `["ONE", "TWO", "THREE"]`. In fact, it’s `[nil, nil, nil]`. Each time through the block, the block evaluates to the return value of `puts` to be `nil`.

### Can you tell me the three levels of method access control for classes and modules?  What do they imply about the method?

**All methods**, no matter the access control, can be **accessed within the class**.  But what about outside callers?

* _Public_ methods enforce **no access control** -- they can be called in any scope.
* _Protected_ methods are only accessible to **other objects of the same class**.
* _Private_ methods are only accessible within the **context of the current object**.

```ruby
class AccessLevel
  def something_interesting
    another = AccessLevel.new
    another.public_method
    another.protected_method
    another.private_method
  end

  def public_method
    puts "Public method. Nice to meet you."
  end

  protected

  def protected_method
    puts "Protected method. Sweet!"
  end

  private 

  def private_method
    puts "Incoming exception!"
  end
end

AccessLevel.new.something_interesting
 #=> Public method.  Nice to meet you.
 #=> Protected method.  Sweet!
 #=> NoMethodError: private method ‘private_method’ called for
 #=>  #<AccessLevel:0x898c8>

### What does self mean?

`self` _always_ refers to the current object.  But this question is more difficult than it seems because **Classes are also objects** in ruby. 

```ruby
class WhatIsSelf
  def test
    puts "At the instance level, self is #{self}"
  end

  def self.test
    puts "At the class level, self is #{self}"
  end
end

WhatIsSelf.test 
 #=> At the class level, self is WhatIsSelf

WhatIsSelf.new.test 
 #=> At the instance level, self is #<WhatIsSelf:0x28190>
```

This short snippet indicates two things:

- at the _class level_, self is the **class**, in this case WhatIsSelf.
- at the _instance level_, self is the **instance in context**, in this case the instance of WhatIsSelf at memory location 0x28190.

### What is a Proc?

Essentially, Procs are **anonymous methods** (or nameless functions) containing code. They can be placed inside a variable and **passed around** like any other object or scalar value. They are created by **Proc.new**, **lambda**, and **blocks** (invoked by the yield keyword).  

**Note:** Procs and lambdas do have subtle, but important, [differences](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Method_Calls#Understanding_blocks.2C_Procs_and_methods) in ruby v1.8.6.  However, I wouldn't expect a candidate talk about these nitty-gritty details during an interview. (Kudos to Noah Thorp)

```ruby
# wants a proc, a lambda, AND a block
def three_ways(proc, lambda, &block)
  proc.call
  lambda.call
  yield # like block.call
  puts "#{proc.inspect} #{lambda.inspect} #{block.inspect}"
end

anonymous = Proc.new { puts "I'm a Proc for sure." }
nameless  = lambda { puts "But what about me?" }

three_ways(anonymous, nameless) do
  puts "I'm a block, but could it be???"
end
 #=> I'm a Proc for sure.
 #=> But what about me?
 #=> I'm a block, but could it be???
 #=> #<Proc:0x00089d64> #<Proc:0x00089c74> #<Proc:0x00089b34>

### What is the difference between `#==` and `#eql?`?  

`#eql?` is sometimes an alternate equality. `Hash` uses `#eql?` to test for hash key equality. `Numeric` types perform type conversion across `#==` but not across `#eql?`, thus `#eql?` performs a stricter comparison than `#==` in that case.

### Describe a closure in Ruby

A closure is an object that is both an invocable function together with a variable binding. The object retains access to the local variables that were in scope at the time of the object definition.

A closure in Ruby retain variables by reference; the closure also extends the lifetimes of its variables. A closure's reference to its variables is dynamically bound that means the values of the variables are resolved when the `Proc` object is executed.

It also possible to alter a closure. The binding of a closure can be altered using `#binding`.

### What is the difference between calling "super" and calling "super()"

* A call to `super` invokes the parent method with the same arguments that were passed to the child method. An error will therefore occur if the arguments passed to the child method don’t match what the parent is expecting.

* A call to `super()` invokes the parent method without any arguments, as presumably expected. As always, being explicit in your code is a good thing.

### When might you use the `do`/`end` syntax versus using the curly bracket syntax for a block?  

The `do`/`end` syntax for a block is commonly used for multi-line statements. An alternate convention is to use curly bracket syntax for blocks that return a value while using `do`/`end` syntax for blocks that change the state of the system somehow and do not return a value.

### Explain the difference between

The `+=` operator re-initializes the variable with a new value, so `a += b` is equivalent to `a = a + b`.

Therefore, while it may _seem_ that `+=` is mutating the value, it’s actually creating a _new_ object and pointing the the old variable to that new object.

This is perhaps easier to understand if written as follows:

```ruby
foo = "foo"
foo2 = foo
foo.concat "bar"

puts foo
  => "foobar"
puts foo2
  => "foobar"

foo += "baz"
puts foo
  => "foobarbaz"
puts foo2
  => "foobar"
```

(Examining the `object_id` of `foo` and `foo2` will also demonstrate that new objects are being created.)

The difference has implications for performance and also has different mutation behavior than one might expect.

### How exactly does it work?

When a parameter is passed with `&` in front of it (indicating that is it to be used as a block), Ruby will call `to_proc` on it in an attempt to make it usable as a block. `Symbol#to_proc` quite handily returns a `Proc` that will invoke the method of the corresponding name on whatever is passed to it, thus enabling our little shorthand trick to work.

### Is the line of code below valid Ruby code? If so, what does it do?

Yes, it’s valid. Here’s how to understand what it does:

The `->` operator creates a new Proc, which is one of Ruby’s function types. (The `->` is often called the “stabby proc”. It’s also called the “stabby lambda”, as it creates a new Proc instance that is a lambda. All lambdas are Procs, but not all Procs are lambdas. There are some slight differences between the two.)

This particular Proc takes one parameter (namely, `a`). When the Proc is called, Ruby executes the block `p a`, which is the equivalent of `puts(a.inspect)` (a subtle, but useful, difference which is why `p` is sometimes better than `puts` for debugging). So this Proc simply prints out the string that is passed to it.

You can call a Proc by using either the `call` method on Proc, or by using the square bracket syntax, so this line of code also invokes the Proc and passes it the string “Hello World”.

So putting that all together, this line of code (a) creates a Proc that takes a single parameter `a` which it prints out and (b) invokes that Proc and passes it the string “Hello world”. So, in short, this line of code prints “Hello World”.

### What will be the result of each of the following lines of code

The first three lines of code will all print out 10, as expected.
The next two lines of code will both print out 3, as expected.

However, the last line of code (i.e., `sum (1,2)`) will result in the following:

```ruby
    syntax error, unexpected ',', expecting ')'
    sum (1, 2)
           ^
```    

The problem is the space between the method name and the open parenthesis. Because of the space, the Ruby parser thinks that `(1, 2)` is an expression that represents a single argument, but `(1, 2)` is not a valid Ruby expression, hence the error.

Note that the problem does not occur with single argument methods (as shown with our `timesTwo` method above), since the single value _is_ a valid expression (e.g., `(5)` is a valid expression which simply evaluates to 5).

There are multiple ways to do this, but one possible answer is:

```ruby
(1. .20).inject([0, 1]) { | fib | fib << fib.last(2).inject(: +)}
```

As you go up the sequence `fib`, you sum, or `inject(:+)`, the last two elements in the array and add the result to the end of `fib`.

Note: `inject` is an alias of `reduce`

### Why doesn't Ruby support method overloading?

*Overloading* is a term that simply doesn't even make sense in Ruby. It is basically a synonym for "static argument-based dispatch", but Ruby doesn't have static dispatch at all. So, the reason why Ruby doesn't support static dispatch based on the arguments, is because it doesn't support static dispatch, period. It doesn't support static dispatch of any kind, whether argument-based or otherwise.

### What is the differnece between `extend` and `include` in ruby?

*   `include` mixes in specified module methods as instance methods in the target class
*   `extend` mixes in specified module methods as class methods in the target class

Given the following class definitions:

```ruby
module ReusableModule
  def module_method
    puts "Module Method: Hi there! I'm a module method"
  end
end

class ClassThatIncludes
  include ReusableModule
end
class ClassThatExtends
  extend ReusableModule
end
```

Here’s how `ClassThatIncludes` behaves:

```sh
# A class method does not exist
>> ClassThatIncludes.module_method
NoMethodError: undefined method `module_method' for ClassThatIncludes:Class

# A valid instance method exists
>> ClassThatIncludes.new.module_method
Module Method: Hi there! I'm a module method
=> nil
```

Here’s how `ClassThatExtends` behaves:

```sh
# A valid class method exists
>> ClassThatExtends.module_method
Module Method: Hi there! I'm a module method
=> nil

# An instance method does not exist
ClassThatExtends.new.module_method
NoMethodError: undefined method `module_method' for #<ClassThatExtends:0x007ffa1e0317e8>
```

We should mention that `object.extend ExampleModule` makes `ExampleModule` methods available as singleton methods in the object.
